      <description>BHAGAVAN VYASA, the celebrated compiler of the Vedas, was the son of the great sage Parasara. It was he who gave to the world the divine epic of the Mahabharata. Having conceived the Mahabharata he thought of the means of giving the sacred story to the world. He meditated on Brahma, the Creator, who manifestedhimself before him. Vyasa saluted him with bowed head and folded hands and prayed: &amp;ldquo;Lord, I have conceived an excellent work, but cannot think of one who can take it down to my dictation.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You must certainly become my wife, whoever you may be.&amp;rdquo; Thus said the great King Santanu to the goddess Ganga who stood before him in human form, intoxicating his senses with her superhuman loveliness. The king earnestly offered for her love his kingdom, his wealth, his all, his very life. Ganga replied: &amp;ldquo;O king, I shall become your wife. But on certain conditions that neither you nor anyone else should ever ask me who I am, or whence I come.</description>

      <description>WITH joy the king received to his heart and his kingdom the resplendent and youthful prince Devavrata and crowned him as the Yuvaraja, the heir apparent. Four years went by. One day as the king was wandering on the banks of the Yamuna, the air was suddenly filled with a fragrance so divinely sweet that the king sought for its cause, and he traced it to a maiden so lovely that she seemed a goddess.</description>

      <description>CHITRANGADA, the son of Satyavati, was killed in battle with a Gandharva. As he died childless, his brother, Vichitravirya, was the rightful heir and was duly crowned king. And as he was a minor, Bhishma governed the kingdom in his name till be came of age. When Vichitravirya reached adolescence Bhishma cast about for a bride for him. And as he heard that the daughters of the king of Kasi were to choose theirhusbands according to the ancient Kshatriya practice he went there to secure them for his brother.</description>

      <description>IN ancient times, there was a bitter struggle between the devas or gods and the asuras or demons for the lordship of the three worlds. Both belligerents had illustrious preceptors. Brihaspati who was pre-eminent in the knowledge of the Vedas was the guiding spirit of the devas, while the asuras relied on Sukracharya&amp;rsquo;s profound wisdom. The asuras had the formidable advantage that Sukracharya alone possessed the secret of Sanjivini which could recall the dead to life.</description>

      <description>ONE warm afternoon, pleasantly tired with sporting in the woods Devayani and the daughters of Vrishaparva, king of the asuras, went to bathe in the cool waters of a sylvan pool, depositing their garlands on the bank before they entered its waters. A strong breeze blew their clothes together into a huddled heap and when they came to take them up again, some mistakes naturally occurred. It so happened that princess Sarmishtha, the daughter of the king, clad herself in Devayani&amp;rsquo;s clothes.</description>

      <description>EMPEROR Yayati was one of the ancestors of the Pandavas. He had never known defeat. He followed the dictates of the sastras, adored the gods and venerated his ancestors with intense devotion. He became famous as a ruler devoted to the welfare of his subjects. But as has already been told, he became prematurely old by the curse of Sukracharya for having wronged his wife Devayani. In the words of the poet of the Mahabharata: &amp;ldquo;Yayati attained that old age which destroys beauty and brings on miseries.</description>

      <description>THE sage Mandavya who had acquired strength of mind and knowledge of the scriptures, spent his days in penance and the practice of truth.
He lived in a hermitage in the forests on the outskirts of the city. One day while he was immersed in silent contemplation under the shade of a tree outside his hut of leaves, a band of robbers fled through the woods with officers of the king in hot pursuit.</description>

      <description>SURA, the grandfather of Sri Krishna, was a worthy scion of the Yadava race. His daughter Pritha was noted for her beauty and virtues. Since his cousin Kuntibhoja was childless, Sura gave his daughter Pritha in adoption to him. From that time she was known by the name of Kunti after her adoptive father. When Kunti was a little girl, the sage Durvasa stayed for a time as a guest in her father&amp;rsquo;s house and she served the sage for a year with all care, patience and devotion.</description>

      <description>To the north of the Ganga was the great kingdom Kosala, made fertile by the river Sarayu. Its capital was Ayodhya, built by Manu, the famous ruler of the Solar dynasty. From Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s description of the capital Kosala, it is clear that ancient Ayodhya was not inferior to our modern cities. Even in ancient India city civilisation had reached a high level. King Dasaratha ruled the kingdom from the capital city of Ayodhya.</description>

      <description>ONE day King Pandu was out hunting. A sage and his wife were also sporting in the forest in the guise of deer. Pandu shot the male with an arrow, in ignorance of the fact that it was a sage in disguise. Stricken to death the rishi thus cursed Pandu: &amp;ldquo;Sinner, you will meet with death the moment you taste the pleasures of the bed.&amp;rdquo; Pandu was heartbroken at this curse and retreated to the forest with his wives after entrusting his kingdom to Bhishma and Vidura and lived there a life of perfect abstinence.</description>

      <description>THE five sons of Pandu and the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra grew up in mirth and merriment at Hastinapura. Bhima excelled them all in physical prowess. He used to bully Duryodhana and the other Kauravas by dragging them by the hair and beating them. A great swimmer, he would dive, into pools, with one or more of them clasped helpless in his arms, and remain under water till they were almost drowned.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas and the Kauravas learnt the practice of arms first from Kripacharya and later from Drona. A day was fixed for a test and exhibition of their proficiency in the use of arms in the presence of the royal family and as the public had also been invited to witness the performance of their beloved princes. There was a large and enthusiastic crowd. Arjuna displayed superhuman skill with his weapons and the vast assemblage was lost in wonder and admiration.</description>

      <description>DRONA, the son of a brahmana named Bharadwaja, after completing his study of the Vedas and the Vedangas, devoted himself to the art of archery and became a great master.
Drupada, the son of the king of Panchala, who was a friend of Bharadwaja, was a fellow-student of Drona in the hermitage and there grew up between them the generous intimacy of youth.
Drupada, in his boyish enthusiasm, used often to tell Drona that he would give him half his kingdom when he ascended the throne.</description>

      <description>THE jealousy of Duryodhana began to grow at the sight of the physical strength of Bhima and the dexterity of Arjuna. Karna and Sakuni became Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s evil counsellors in planning wily stratagems. As for poor Dhritarashtra, he was a wise man no doubt and he also loved his brother&amp;rsquo;s sons, but he was weak of will and dotingly attached to his own children. For his children&amp;rsquo;s sake the worse became the better reason, and he would sometimes even knowingly follow the wrong path.</description>

      <description>AFTER taking reverential leave of the elders and embracing their comrades, the Pandavas proceeded to Varanavata. The citizens accompanied them a part of their way and returned unwillingly to the city. Vidura pointedly warned Yudhishthira in words intelligible only to the prince: &amp;ldquo;He alone will escape from danger who forestalls the intentions of an astute enemy. There are weapons sharper than those made of steel. And the wise man who would escape destruction must know the means to guard against them.</description>

      <description>IN the city of Ekachakra, the Pandavas stayed in the guise of brahmanas, begging their food in the brahmana streets and bringing what they got to their mother, who would wait anxiously till their return. If they did not come back in time, she would be worried, fearing that some evil might have befallen them. Kunti would divide the food they brought in two equal portions. One half would go to Bhima.</description>

      <description>WHILE the Pandavas were living in disguise as brahmanas at Ekachakrapura, news of the swayamvara of Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada, King of Panchala, reached them. Many brahmanas of Ekachakrapura planned to go to Panchala in the hope of receiving the customary gifts and to see the festivities and pageant of a royal wedding. Kunti, with her motherly instinct, read her sons&#39; desire to go to Panchala and win Draupadi. So she told Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;We have been in this city so long that it is time to think of going somewhere else.</description>

      <description>WHEN news of the incidents that took place during the swayamvara at Panchala reached Hastinapura, Vidura was happy. He immediately went to Dhritarashtra and said: &amp;ldquo;O King, our family has become stronger because the daughter of Drupada has become our daughter-in-law. Our stars are good.&amp;rdquo; Dhritarashtra thought in his blind fondness for his son that it was Duryodhana, who had also gone to take part in the swayamvara, that had won Draupadi.</description>

      <description>IN the stories narrated in the Puranas, birds and beasts speak like men, and sometimes they give sound advice and even teach spiritual wisdom. But the natural qualities of those creatures are adroitly made to peep through this human veil. One of the characteristic beauties of the Puranic literature is this happy fusion of nature and imagination. In a delightful passage in the Ramayana, Hanuman, who is described as very wise and learned, is made to frolic with apish joy, when he imagined that the beautiful damsel he saw at Ravana&amp;rsquo;s inner courtyard was Sita.</description>

      <description>In course of time, Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s sons were born Rama of Kausalya and Bharata of Kaikeyi. Sumitra gave birth to twins, Lakshmana and Satrughna. She had drunk the divine payasam twice. In proportion to the quantity of payasam drunk by the respective mothers, the sons are traditionally considered to be parts of Vishnu. Rama was thus half- Vishnu. But such calculations have no meaning, as it is impossible to measure the Infinite arithmetically.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas ruled Indraprastha in all glory. Those who surrounded Yudhishthira urged him to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice and assume the title of Emperor. It is evident that imperialism had an irresistible glamour even in those days. Yudhishthira sought Sri Krishna&amp;rsquo;s advice in this matter. When Krishna learnt that Dharmaputra desired to see him, he set out in a chariot harnessed with swift horses and reached Indraprastha. Yudhishthira said: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;My people urge me to perform Rajasuya, but as you know, only he who can secure the respect and allegiance of all kings, can perform that sacrifice and win the status of emperor.</description>

      <description>BRIHADRATHA, the commander of three regiments, reigned in the kingdom of Magadha and attained celebrity as a great hero. He married the twin daughters of the raja of Kasi and vowed to them that he would not show any partiality to either. Brihadratha was not blessed with a child for a long time. When he became old, he handed over his kingdom to his ministers, went to the forest with his two wives and engaged himself in austerities.</description>

      <description>THE practice of staging a walkout from an assembly in protest against something is nothing new. We learn from the Mahabharata that walkout was resorted to even in ancient times. The India of those days consisted of a number of independent states. Though there was one dharma and one culture throughout the land, the autonomy of each state was scrupulosly respected. Occasionally, some strong and ambitious monarch would seek the assent of his fellow kings to his overlordship, which would sometimes be given without question.</description>

      <description>AT the close of the Rajasuya, the princes, priests and elders, who had gathered for the purpose, took leave and returned to their places. Vyasa also came to say farewell. Dharmaputra rose and received him with due respect and sat by his side. The sage said: &amp;ldquo;O son of Kunti, you have got the title of emperor which you eminently deserve. May the illustrious Kuru race gain even greater glory through you.</description>

      <description>DURYODHANA and Sakuni went to Dhritarashtra. Sakuni opened the conversation. He said: &amp;ldquo;O king,Duryodhana is wan with grief and anxiety. You are paying no attention to his unbearable sorrow. Why this unconcern?&amp;rdquo; Dhritarashtra who doted on his son embraced Duryodhana and said: &amp;ldquo;I do not see why you should be disconsolate. What is here that you already do not enjoy? The whole world is at your feet. When you are surrounded by all kinds of pleasures like the very gods, why should you pine in sorrow?</description>

      <description>AT THE sight of Vidura, Yudhishthira anxiously inquired: &amp;ldquo;Why are you so cheerless? Is it well with all our relations in Hastinapura? Are the king and the princes well?&amp;rdquo; Vidura acquainted him with his mission: &amp;ldquo;Everyone in Hastinapura is well. How fares it with you all? I have come to invite you on behalf of King Dhritarashtra to come and see the newly erected hall of games. A beautiful hall has been erected there even like yours.</description>

He said to her: &amp;ldquo;O revered princess, Yudhishthira fell under the spell of the game of dice and has wagered and lost even you. Now you belong to Duryodhana. I have come by Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s command to take you to serve in his household as maid servant, which will hereafter be your office.&amp;rdquo; Draupadi, the spouse of the emperor who had performed Rajasuya, was dumbfounded, at this strange message.</description>

      <description>WHEN the Pandavas set out for the forest, there arose a great clamor of lamentation from people who thronged the streets and climbed the roofs and towers and trees to see them go. The princes, who, of yore, rode in jewelled chariots or on lordly elephants to strains of auspicious music, now walked away from their birthright on weary feet, accompanied by weeping crowds. On all sides cries arose of: &amp;ldquo;Fie and Alas!</description>

      <description>As SOON as the news of the slaying of Sisupala by Krishna reached his friend Salva, he became very angry and besieged Dwaraka with a mighty force. Krishna having not yet returned to Dwaraka, old Ugrasena was in charge of the defence of the city. The sieges described in the Mahabharata seem very much like those in wars of the present day. Dwaraka was a strongly garrisoned fortress built on an island and well provided with means of defence.</description>

      <description>IN the beginning of their stay in the forest, Bhima and Draupadi used, on occasions, to argue with Yudhishthira. They would plead that only righteous anger befitted a kshatriya and thatpatience and forbearance under slights and insults were not worthy of him. They would quote weighty authorities and argue vehemently in support of their contention. Yudhishthira would firmly reply that they should abide by the promise they had made and that forbearance was the highest virtue of all.</description>

      <description>That was the time when the famous king of the Solar dynasty, Trisanku, was reigning, who was so much in love with the beauty of his body that he could not bear the thought of parting with it at death and desired to ascend to heaven in that very body. Vasishtha, his preceptor, whom he approached for help in realising his wish, advised him to give up attempting the impossible. Dissatisfied with Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s response, the King approached the sage&amp;rsquo;s sons and sought their help.</description>

      <description>BALARAMA and Krishna came with their retinue to the abode of the Pandavas in the forest. Deeply distressed by what he saw, Balarama said to Krishna: &amp;ldquo;O Krishna, it would seem that virtue and wickedness bear contrary fruit in this life. For see, the wicked Duryodhana is ruling his kingdom clad in silk and gold, while the virtuous Yudhishthira lives in the forest wearing the bark of trees. Seeing such unmerited prosperity and undeserved privation, men have lost their faith in God.</description>

      <description>THE brahmanas, who had been with Yudhishthira in Indraprastha, had followed him to the forest. It was difficult to maintain such a large establishment. Some time after Arjuna had gone on his quest of Pasupata, a brahmana sage named Lomasa came to the abode of the Pandavas. He advised Yudhishthira to minimize his retinue before going on pilgrimage as it would be difficult to move freely from place to place with a large following.</description>

      <description>IT is an error to think that it is easy for a person to lead a life of chastity if he is brought up in complete ignorance of sensual pleasures. Virtue guarded only by ignorance is very insecure as illustrated by the following story. It is told in the Ramayana also, but not in the same detail. Vibhandaka who was resplendent like Brahma, the Creator, lived with his son Rishyasringa in a forest.</description>

      <description>IN the course of their wanderings, the Pandavas reached the hermitage of Raibhya on the banks of the Ganga. Lomasa told them the story of the place: &amp;ldquo;This is the ghat where Bharata, the son of Dasaratha, bathed. These waters cleansed Indra of the sin of killing Vritra unfairly. Here also Sanatkumara became one with God. Aditi, the mother of the gods, offered oblations on this mountain and prayed to be blessed with a son.</description>

      <description>YAVAKRIDA studied the Vedas and became learned. He grew vain with the thought that he had acquired the knowledge of the Vedas through the boon of Indra and not through human tutelage. Bharadwaja did not like this and feared that his son might ruin himself by slighting Raibhya. He thought it necessary to warm him. &amp;ldquo;The gods,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;grant boons to foolish people who persistently practise penances, as intoxicants are sold to fools for money.</description>

      <description>KING Brihadyumna, a disciple of the sage Raibhya, performed a great sacrifice at which he requested his teacher to let his two sons Paravasu and Arvavasu officiate. With the permission of their father, both of them went joyfully to the capital of the king. While arrangements were being made for the sacrifice, Paravasu desired one day to go and see his wife and, walking alone all night, he reached his hermitage before dawn.</description>

      <description>WHILE the Pandavas were wandering among holy places in the forest, they came one day to the hermitage of the personages immortalized in theUpanishads. Lomasa told Yudhishthira the story of that place. Udalaka, a great sage and teacher of Vedanta, had a disciple named Kagola, who was virtuous and devoted but had no great learning. So, the other disciples used to laugh and mock at him. Uddalaka, however, attached no great weight to his disciple&amp;rsquo;s lack of erudition but really appreciated his virtues, devotion and good conduct and gave his daughter Sujata in marriage to him.</description>

I find no joy in life in the absence of Arjuna.&amp;rdquo; The other Pandavas shared Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s wretchedness at separation from Arjuna, who had gone to the Himalayas in quest of divine weapons. Bhimasena told Draupadi: &amp;ldquo;Blessed lady, I myself feel the same about Arjuna and what you say makes me thrill with love and sympathy.

Yudhishthira happened to talk of the virtues of the fair sex and said: &amp;ldquo;What greater wonder is there in this world than the patience and the chastity of woman? She gives birth to a child after cherishing it in her womb as dearer than life itself. She brings it into the world inpain and anxiety and thence forward her one thought is for its health and happiness.</description>

      <description>MANY brahmanas visited the Pandavas during their exile. And one such, returning to Hastinapura, went to see Dhritarashtra, who received him with due honor. The brahmana told him how the Pandavas, born princes, were, by unkind destiny, at the mercy of the wind and the sun and suffered great privations. Dhritarashtra was probably sorry to hear this. But what troubled him most were the consequences to his own sons. CouldYudhishthira continue to hold the justly wrathful Bhima in check?</description>

Duryodhana and Karna went with unconcealed joy at the very thought of being able to gloat on the sad plight of the Pandavas. They themselves camped in luxurious rest houses in a place four miles off the abode of the Pandavas. They inspected the herds of cows and took stock of them. After counting the cows, bulls and calves, they enjoyed the dance, the hunt, the sylvan sports and other entertainment’s arranged for them.</description>

      <description>WHILE the Pandavas were dwelling in the forest, Duryodhana celebrated a great sacrifice with much pomp and splendor. He wanted to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice, but the brahmanas told him that he could not do that while Yudhishthira and Dhritarashtra were alive and advised him to perform the sacrifice known as the Vaishnava instead. He accepted this advice and celebrated the Vaishnava with great splendor. But when the ceremony was over, the citizens began to talk among themselves that Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice had not come up to even a sixteenth part of Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s Rajasuya in magnificence.</description>

      <description>THE stipulated period of twelve years was drawing to a close. One day, a deer was rubbing itself against a poor brahmana&amp;rsquo;s fire-kindling mortar and as it turned to go, the mortar got entangled in its horns and the affrighted animal fled wildly with it into the forest. In those days matches were unknown and fire was kindled with pieces of wood by mechanical friction. &amp;ldquo;Alas! The deer is running away with my fire-kindler.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;O BRAHMANAS, we have been deceived by the sons of Dhritarashtra, cheated out of our kingdom and reduced to poverty. Still we have passed these years cheerfully with joy in the forest. The thirteenth year of exile has come, and with it the time for us to part from you. For we have to spend the next twelve months undiscovered by the spies of Duryodhana. God knows when the day will dawn which will see us together again, without fear or concealment.</description>

      <description>YUDHISHTHIRA put on the garb of a sanyasin. Arjuna transformed himself into a eunuch. Others also disguised themselves. But no disguise could take away their natural charm, grace and nobility of appearance. When they went to King Virata seeking service, they seemed to him born to command and rule rather than to serve. He hesitated, at first, to engage them in service but yielding to their urgent solicitations, he finally appointed them to the places they sought of him.</description>

      <description>THE fate of Kichaka made Draupadi an object of fear to the people of Virata. &amp;ldquo;This woman, so beautiful that she captures all hearts, is as dangerous as she is lovely, for the Gandharvas guard her. She is a great danger to the people of the city and the members of the royal household, for the Gandharvas may stop at nothing in their jealous anger. It would be best to send her out of the city.</description>

      <description>UTTARA, the son of Virata, set off with enthusiasm from the city in his chariot with Brihannala as his charioteer and commanded the latter to drive quickly to the place where the Kauravas had rounded up the cows. Willingly, the horses were put to their best speed. And presently the Kaurava army was sighted, at first a gleaming, line, enveloped in a cloud of dust that seemed to go up to the skies.</description>

      <description>THE chariot of Arjuna thundered on its way, seeming to shake the earth. The hearts of the Kauravas quaked when they heard the twang of the Gandiva bow. &amp;ldquo;Our army must be arrayed well and with care. Arjuna, has come,&amp;rdquo; said Drona anxiously. Duryodhana did not at all like the honor Drona did Arjuna by this anxiety. He said to Karna: &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas&#39; pledge was that they would spend twelve years in the forest and the following year undiscovered.</description>

      <description>AFTER defeating Susarma, king of Trigarta, Virata returned to his capital amidst the acclamations of the citizens. When he reached his palace, he saw that Uttara was not there and the womenfolk told him with much elation that Uttara had set out to conquer the Kauravas. They had not a doubt that their hand some prince could conquer the whole world. But the king&amp;rsquo;s heart sank within him at the news, for he knew the impossible task which the delicately nurtured prince had taken on himself with no better following than a eunuch.</description>

      <description>THE thirteenth year during which the Pandavas had to remain undiscovered came to an end. No longer obliged to be in disguise, they left Virata&amp;rsquo;s capital as Pandavas and settled openly in Upaplavya, another place in Matsya territory. From there, they sent emissaries to summon their friends and relatives. From Dwaraka came Balarama and Krishna with Arjuna’s wife Subhadra, and her son, Abhimanyu and accompanied by many Yadava warriors. Loud and long was the blare of trumpet-conchs as the Matsya prince and the Pandavas went forth to receive Janardana.</description>

      <description>Viswamitra and the two princes spent the night on the bank of the river Sarayu. Before retiring Viswamitra initiated the princes in two secret mantras Bala and Atibala, which had the virtue of guarding them from fatigue and harm. They slept on the verdant bank that night and rising at dawn proceeded on their journey. They reached Kamashrama in Anga Desa. After presenting the princes to the rishis there, Viswamitra recounted to them the history of the ashrama.</description>

      <description>HAVING sent Drupada&amp;rsquo;s brahmana to Hastinapura on the peace mission, the Pandavas sent word, at the same time, to the princes likely to favor their cause to collect their forces and hold themselves in readiness for war. To Dwaraka, Arjuna went himself. Having understood through his spies the turn events were taking, Duryodhana too did not remain idle. Learning that Vasudeva (Krishna) was back in his home city, he sped towards Dwaraka in his chariot, as fast as his swiftest horses could take him.</description>

      <description>SALYA, the ruler of Madradesa, was the brother of Madri, the mother of Nakula and Sahadeva. He heard that the Pandavas were camping in the city of Upaplavya and making preparations for war. He collected a very big army and set off towards that city to join the Pandavas. Salya&amp;rsquo;s army was so large that where it halted for rest, the encampment extended over a length of nearly fifteen miles. News of Salya and his marching forces reached Duryodhana.</description>

      <description>INDRA, the Lord of the three regions, was once so drunk with pride that he quite forgot the courteous manners and forms that the gods had hitherto observed. When Brihaspati, preceptor of the gods, foremost in all branches of learning, and venerated alike by the gods and the asuras, came to his court, Indra did not rise from his seat to receive the acharya or ask him to be seated and failed to do the customary honors.</description>

Nahusha started well, assisted by the merit and the fame earned by him while he was a king on earth. Thereafter, he fell on evil days.The assumption of the kingship of the gods filled him with arrogance, He lost his humility and became filled with lawless desires.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas were camping at Upaplavya in Virata&amp;rsquo;s territory. From there, they sent emissaries to all friendly rulers. Contingents arrived from all parts of the country and soon, the Pandavas had a mighty force of seven divisions. The Kauravas did likewise and collected an army of eleven divisions. Then, as now, a division was made up of all arms grouped together in accordance with established military practice. In those days, a division consisted of 21,870 chariots, an equal number of elephants, thrice as many horses and five times as many foot soldiers, and they were provided with weapons of all kinds and other war equipment.</description>

      <description>AFTER he had despatched Sanjaya to the Pandavas, Dhritarashtra, filled with anxiety, could not get a wink of sleep that night. He sent for Vidura and spent the whole night talking to him. &amp;ldquo;To give the Pandavas their share of the kingdom is the safest plan,&amp;rdquo; said Vidura. &amp;ldquo;Only this can bring good to both sides. Treat the Pandavas and your own sons with equal affection. In this case, the right course is also the wise one.</description>

      <description>SATYAKI accompanied Govinda (Krishna) to Hastinapura. Before setting out on his journey, Krishna had a lone discussion with the Pandavas. Even the mighty Bhima, rather surprisingly, supported a peaceful settlement. &amp;ldquo;Let not the race be destroyed. Peace is very much to be preferred,&amp;rdquo; said he. The poet Vyasa makes Bhima speak thus in order to show that truly great warriors desire peace, and that to seek peace is not a sign of fear.</description>

      <description>ANY ray of hope there might have been of a peaceful settlement when Krishna went to Hastinapura was extinguished when he returned and narrated what happened. Kunti was overwhelmed with grief when she learnt that it was to be war to the death. &amp;ldquo;How can I&amp;rdquo; reflected Kunti, &amp;ldquo;give my thoughts tongue and say to my sons, &amp;lsquo;Bear the insults.

      <description>GOVINDA reached Upaplavya and told the Pandavas what had happened in Hastinapura. &amp;ldquo;I spoke urging what was right and what was also good for them. But, it was all in vain. There is now no way out except the fourth, that is, the last alternative of war. The foolish Duryodhana would not listen to the advice tendered to him by the elders in the assembly.

Yudhishthira, Krishna and others gave the broad- shouldered warrior a glad welcome. Bowing to Drupada and Virata, the visitor seated himself beside Dharmaputra. &amp;ldquo;I have come to Kurukshetra,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;learning that the descendants of Bharata have let themselves be overwhelmed by greed, anger and hatred and that the peace talks have broken down and that war has been declared.</description>

Having heard of Krishna and his renown, she wished to be united to him in wedlock and the desire daily grew in intensity. Her relatives approved the idea, all except her eldest brother Rukma, the heir apparent, between whom and Krishna there was no love lost. Rukma pressed his father not to give Rukmini in marriage to the ruler of Dwaraka but to marry her instead to Sisupala, the king of Chedi.</description>

The grandsire, now the Kaurava Generalissimo, was with Duryodhana seeking to inspire him with his own heroic spirit and cheerfulness. Bhishma spoke of the strength, skill and prowess of the warriors ranged on the Kauravas&#39; side. Duryodhana was cheered up. Presently, Karna became the subject of their talk. &amp;ldquo;Karna has earned your affection,&amp;rdquo; said Bhishma, &amp;ldquo;but I do not think much of him.</description>

The code of conduct in war and methods of warfare vary from time to time. It is only if what was in vogue at the time of the Mahabharata war is kept in mind that we can understand the epic.

At this tense moment, both armies saw with amazement Yudhishthira, the steadfast and brave son of Pandu, suddenly doff his armor and put away his weapons. Descending from his chariot, he proceeded on foot towards the commander of the Kaurava forces. &amp;ldquo;What is this that Yudhishthira is doing?&amp;rdquo; asked everyone and was puzzled by this sudden and silent proceeding on the part of the Pandava.</description>

On the second day, the army was most carefully arrayed and everything was done to instil confidence. Duryodhana, filled with conceit on account of the success on the first day, stood in the center of his army and addressed his warriors. &amp;ldquo;Heroes in armor&amp;rdquo;, he said in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;our victory is assured.</description>

      <description>ON the morning of the third day Bhishma arrayed his army in eagle formation and himself led it while Duryodhana and his forces protected the rear. So great was the care taken over every detail that the Kauravas were certain that there could be no mishap for them that day. The Pandavas too arrayed their forces with skill. Dhananjaya and Dhrishtadyumna decided in favor of a crescent formation of their army so as more effectually to cope with the eagle formation of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s forces.</description>

      <description>THE battle was very much the same every day and the narrative is one of monotonous fighting and killing. Still, the great battle is the central event in the Mahabharata and, if we skip over it, we cannot fully understand the epic heroes of that crowded stage. At break of day, Bhishma arrayed the Kaurava forces again. Surrounded by Drona, Duryodhana and others, the grandsire looked verily like great Indra, holding his thunder bolt, surrounded by the devas.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I AM like a shipwrecked man seeking to save himself by swimming in a storm tossed ocean. I shall surely drown, overwhelmed in this sea of sorrow.&amp;rdquo; Again and again, when Sanjaya related the happenings of the great battle, Dhritarashtra would thus lament, unable to bear his grief. &amp;ldquo;Bhima is going to kill all my sons,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I do not believe there is anyone with prowess enough in our army to protect my sons from death.</description>

      <description>ACCORDING to Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s order Dhrishtadyumna arrayed the Pandava army in makara (fish) formation for the sixth day&amp;rsquo;s battle. The Kaurava army was arrayed in krauncha (heron) formation. We know, how, similarly, names were given to physical exercise, asanas, or postures. Vyuha was the general name for battle array. Which Vyuha was best for any particular occasion, depended on the requirements of the offensive and defensive plans of the day. What the strength and composition of the forces arrayed should be and what positions they should take up were decided upon, according to the situation as it developed from time to time.</description>

      <description>KING Sagara waited in vain for the return of the princes who had gone in search of the sacrificial horse. After some days he called his grandson, Amsuman, and said: &amp;ldquo;I am anxious to know what has happened to the princes who went to Patala. You are brave; go thither, well-armed and find out what has happened and come back crowned with success.&amp;rdquo; Amsuman went closely following the path of the princes and reached the nether world where he saw and paid salutations to the mighty elephants standing guard at the four quarters.</description>

      <description>DURYODHANA, wounded all over and suffering greatly, went to Bhishma and said: &amp;ldquo;The battle had been going against us every day. Our formations are broken and our warriors are being slain in large numbers. You are looking on doing nothing.&amp;rdquo; The grandsire soothed Duryodhana with comforting words: &amp;ldquo;Why do you let yourself be disheartened? Here are all of us, Drona, Salya, Kritavarma, Aswatthama, Vikarna, Bhagadatta, Sakuni, the two brothers of Avanti, the Trigarta chief, the king of Magadha, and Kripacharya.</description>

      <description>WHEN the eighth day dawned, Bhishma arrayed his army in tortoise formation. Yudhishthira said to Dhrishtadyumna: &amp;ldquo;See there, the enemy is in kurma vyuha (tortoise formation). You have to answer at once with a formation that can break it.&amp;rdquo; Dhrishtadyumna immediately proceeded to his task. The Pandava forces were arrayed in a three-pronged formation. Bhima was at the head of one prong, Satyaki of another, and Yudhishthira at the crest of the middle division.</description>

      <description>ON the morning of the ninth day, before the battle began, Duryodhana was closeted with the grandsire. He gave vent to his bitter feelings of disappointment over the way the battle was going. He uttered words that were like the sharp spears and pained the grandsire greatly but the latter was patient and said sadly: &amp;ldquo;Like ghee on the sacrificial fire I am pouring my life out for you. Why do you seek to mortify me, who have been doing my very utmost for you?</description>

      <description>IT was the tenth day of the battle. Keeping Sikhandin in front of him, Arjuna attacked Bhishma. When Sikhandin&amp;rsquo;s darts pierced his breast, sparks flew from the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s eyes. For a moment the old warrior&amp;rsquo;s anger rose like flaming fire and his eyes glared as if to consume Sikhandin. But, at once, the grandsire restrained himself. He decided not to be provoked into fighting Sikhandin, who was born a woman and to strike whom it seemed unworthy of a warrior.</description>

They cannot all be put in joint command and, if any of them be chosen, each of the others would feel hurt and may not put forth his whole strength in the cause.</description>

      <description>AS SOON AS Drona assumed command of the Kaurava forces Duryodhana, Karna and Duhsasana sat in council and decided on a plan. And Duryodhana went to Dronacharya to put it in operation. &amp;ldquo;Acharya, we desire that you should capture Yudhishthira alive and give him over to us. We desire nothing more, not even a total victory. If you achieve this for us, we shall all be exceedingly satisfied with your conduct of the war.</description>

      <description>THE attempt to capture Yudhishthira alive failed. Drona was speaking to Duryodhana about this. &amp;ldquo;It is clear we cannot succeed in our efforts to seize Yudhishthira so long as Dhananjaya is nearby. It is no want of interest on my part. If by some stratagem we could draw Arjuna away to some other part of the field, I could pierce the Pandava formations and capture Yudhishthira. I promise to seize him and deliver him to you provided he does not flee from the battle, renouncing honor.</description>

      <description>DRONA made many attempts to take Yudhishthira prisoner, but failed. Duryodhana led a large elephant division against Bhima. Bhima defended himself from his chariot with well-aimed arrows. He sent crescent-headed shafts and tore down Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s flag and cut down his bow even as he held it in his hand. Seeing the king harassed in this manner, the Mlechchha king Anga marched against Bhimasena seated on a huge elephant. But Bhima sent shafts that laid the elephant low and killed the Mlechchha king, which resulted in scattering that section of the Kaurava forces in fear and confusion.</description>

After the customary salutation, he addressed him thus in the presence of a large number of generals: &amp;ldquo;Esteemed brahmana, Yudhishthira was quite within your reach yesterday and, if you had really wished to take him no one could have prevented you. Yet, you did not take him, and to me the events of yesterday are inexplicable. I cannot understand what makes it hard for you to carry out your promise to me.</description>

On the way, not far from Mithila, they saw a beautiful ashrama which seemed untenanted. Rama asked Viswamitra: &amp;ldquo;Whose is this ashrama with ancient trees? Why does such a beautiful abode stand deserted?&amp;rdquo; Viswamitra replied: &amp;ldquo;This ashrama is subject to a curse. Sage Gautama lived here with his wife Ahalya, spending his days in peace and holy meditation.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas, proceeding according to plan, had closely followed Abhimanyu when he broke into the Kaurava formation. But Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s son-in-law Jayadratha, the gallant king of the Sindhus, swooped down upon the Pandavas with all his forces and enabled the breach in the formation to be effectively and solidly closed up, so that the Pandavas found it impossible to force their way in. Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s bow. But in an instant, the Saindhava took up another bow and sent unerring shafts at Dharmaputra.</description>

The spies informed Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s friends that Arjuna, having learnt that Jayadratha was the cause of Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s death, had vowed to kill the Sindhu king before sunset next day. Vriddhakshatra, the illustrious king of the Sindhus, was blessed with a son, who was named Jayadratha. At the time of the birth of the prince, a voice was heard to say: &amp;ldquo;This prince will attain great glory and he will attain the happy regions above, slain in battle.</description>

      <description>WHEN the Pandavas saw Duryodhana proceeding in the direction of Arjuna, they attacked the Kaurava army in force so as to hold Drona and prevent him from going to Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s rescue. So, Dhrishtadyumna led his forces repeatedly against Drona. As a result of all this, the Kaurava army had to fight on three fronts, and was greatly weakened. Driving his chariot right against Drona&amp;rsquo;s, Dhrishtadyumna attacked him violently. Drona&amp;rsquo;s chestnut horses and the Panchala&amp;rsquo;s dove-colored ones were entangled with one another and presented a picturesque sight like the clouds at sunset.</description>

      <description>ARJUNA had left Yudhishthira behind to repel Drona&amp;rsquo;s attacks and had gone to make good his word that before sunset Jayadratha would lie dead on the field of battle. Jayadratha had been the main cause of Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s death. He it was who had effectively prevented the relief of Abhimanyu by the Pandavas, and thereby caused Abhimanyu to be isolated, overpowered and slain. We have seen how Yudhishthira in his anxiety sent first Satyaki and then Bhima to join Arjuna in his battle against Jayadratha.</description>

Dhananjaya swore this impossible oath in a moment of thoughtlessness, because the gods had willed it that he should be thus destroyed by his own hand.</description>

      <description>All arrangements for Janaka&amp;rsquo;s yaga had been completed and to Mithila had come many rishis and Brahman&amp;rsquo;s from various kingdoms. Viswamitra and the princeswere duly welcomed. Janaka&amp;rsquo;s preceptor, Satananda, was the first to pay honor to Viswamitra. Janaka followed him. The King said to the sage: &amp;ldquo;I am indeed blessed that you should attend my yaga.&amp;rdquo; Pointing to Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka asked Viswamitra: &amp;ldquo;Who are these god-like youths who resemble each other, and carry their weapons with the proud ease of seasoned warriors?</description>

      <description>ALL those who have heard the story of the Mahabharata know about Ghatotkacha, Bhimasena&amp;rsquo;s famous son by his asura wife. There are two young men among the Mahabharata figures who embody all the qualities of heroism, fortitude, strength, courage, and amiability. They are Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s son, Abhimanyu, and Bhima&amp;rsquo;s son, Ghatotkacha. Both of them gave up their lives on the Kurukshetra battlefield. Towards the latter part of the Mahabharata fight, the hatred roused onboth sides did not find satisfaction in battle conducted during the daytime and close at nightfall.</description>

      <description>WHEN Drona died, the princes of the Kaurava army installed Karna as Generalissimo. Karna stood up in his gorgeous war chariot driven by Salya. The dauntless confidence of his bearing and his great renown as a warrior heartened the Kauravas. The battle again began. Readers of the stars were consulted and the Pandavas chose the propitious hour for grim battle. Arjuna led the attack on Karna, supported by Bhimasena immediately behind his chariot.</description>

      <description>WHEN Duryodhana beheld Karna&amp;rsquo;s death, his grief knew no bounds. Kripacharya was deeply moved by Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s anguish of heart and said: &amp;ldquo;Moved by ambition and greed we placed too great a burden on friends. They have uncomplainingly borne it and laid down their lives on the battlefield and attained the happy regions above. There is but one course left to you to make peace with the Pandavas. Do not, O King, any longer continue this ruinous fight.</description>

      <description>WHEN the war was nearing its end, Balarama arrived at Kurukshetra after completing his tour of holy places. He came just when Bhima and Duryodhana were engaged in their last mortal combat. He saw Bhima aiming the deadly blow which broke Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s thighs, and his anger flamed up at this great breach of the rules of single combat. &amp;ldquo;Fie upon you all! Would any kshatriya hit below the navel? This Bhima has offended the law most disgracefully,&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed and impatiently going up to his brother Krishna, shouted: &amp;ldquo;You can look on and tolerate all this.</description>

      <description>WHEN Aswatthama heard how Duryodhana lay mortally injured, and learnt the details of the combat, his righteous anger swelled like the sea. The deception, practised by the Pandavas in order to bring about his father&amp;rsquo;s end, had been rankling in his mind. Now, when he learnt how Duryodhana had been stricken down mortally against all rules of chivalry, he went to the spot where Duryodhana was lying and there took an oath that he would that night send the Pandavas to the abode of Yama.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;O, DURYODHANA, you are yet alive, hear the news and rejoice! All the Panchalas have been slaughtered. The sons of the Pandavas have also been all done to death. The entire army of theirs has been destroyed. We made a night attack on them when they were asleep. There are only seven survivors now on the Pandava side. On our side, Kripacharya, Kritavarma and I remain.&amp;rdquo; Thus said Aswatthama to the dying Duryodhana who, on hearing this, slowly opened his eyes and, with struggling breath, gasped out these words: &amp;ldquo;Aswatthama, you have indeed done for me what neither the great Bhishma nor the valiant Karna could achieve!</description>

      <description>WHEN the battle was over, Hastinapura was a city of mourning. All the women and children were weeping and lamenting their slain, nearest and dearest. With many thousands of bereaved women accompanying, Dhritarashtra went to the field of battle. At Kurukshetra, the scene of terrible destruction, the blind king thought of all that had passed, and wept aloud. But, of what avail was weeping? &amp;ldquo;O king, words of consolation addressed to a bereaved person do not remove his grief.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas performed the til and water ceremonies for the peace of the souls of the dead warriors and camped on the bank of the Ganga for a month. One day, Narada appeared before Yudhishthira. &amp;ldquo;Son, through Krishna&amp;rsquo;s grace, the valor of Arjuna and the power of your dharma, you were victorious and you are the sovereign lord of the land. Are you happy?&amp;rdquo; he asked. Yudhishthira replied: &amp;ldquo;Bhagavan, it is true the kingdom has come into my possession.</description>

      <description>YUDHISHTHIRA&amp;rsquo;S pain of mind increased everyday as he thought of all the kinsmen that had been killed. He was stricken with intense remorse and decided he must give up the world go to the forest and do penance to expiate his sin. &amp;ldquo;I see no joy or good,&amp;rdquo; he said to his brothers, in taking up the office of king or in worldly enjoyment.

      <description>AFTER the libation ceremony for Bhishma was over, Vyasa narrated to grief-stricken Yudhishthira an episode in Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s life. The wisest of men are sometimes affected by envy and suffer thereby. Brihaspati, teacher to the gods themselves, was master of all knowledge. He was learned in all the Vedas and all the sciences, yet he was once the victim of this debasing emotion and suffered disgrace. Brihaspati had a younger brother, Samvarta, who was also a person of great learning and a very good man.</description>

      <description>Having thus safely handed back to Dasaratha at Mithila the princes entrusted to him in Ayodhya, and after attending the wedding celebrations, Viswamitra took leave of the two kings and went to Himalaya. In the story of Rama, Viswamitra has no further part. Viswamitra may be said to be the foundation of the grand temple of Rama&amp;rsquo;s story. After Rama&amp;rsquo;s wedding in Mithila, we do not see him again. It should be noted that characters that play a leading role in one canto of Valmiki almost fade out in subsequent cantos.</description>

Krishna stopped and descending from his chariot saluted the brahmana.

When it is in his possession, he is soon satisfied, but he becomes the slave of ever-fresh longings and fresh griefs and finds no peace.

      <description>FIFTEEN years passed under king Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s reign, when old Dhritarashtra found himself utterly unable any longer to bear the burden of grief. Hurt by Bhima&amp;rsquo;s occasional reproaches, he found no heart to accept the courtesies and comforts provided under king Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s orders. Unknown to the Pandavas, he secretly fasted and underwent hard penances. Gandhari too observed manifests and inflicted privation on her. And one day Dhritarashtra sent for Dharmaputra and spoke to him thus: &amp;ldquo;Son, blessings on you.</description>

Kunti sat with Gandhari and they ate together. Dhritarashtra asked Yudhishthira to sit by him and gave him his last blessings. Then the old man stepped out and, with his hand resting on Gandhari&amp;rsquo;s shoulder, slowly walked out of the city on his journey to the forest.</description>

      <description>KRISHNA ruled at Dwaraka for thirty-six years after the Kurukshetra battle was over. The Vrishnis, the Bhopas and other branches of the Yadavas belonging to Krishna&amp;rsquo;s tribe spent their days in unrestrained self-indulgence and luxury. They lost all sense of discipline and humility. Once, some rishis came to Dwaraka. The arrogant and irreverent Yadavas mocked these rishis with a practical joke. They dressed up one of their young men like a woman and, presenting him to the revered guests, said: &amp;ldquo;O ye learned men, tell us whether this lady will have a boy or a girl.</description>

They crowned Parikshit, son of Abhimanyu, as emperor and the five brothers left the city with Draupadi. They went out on a pilgrimage, visiting holy places and finally reached the Himalayas. A dog joined them somewhere and kept them company all along.</description>

I cannot believe this to be reality.&amp;rdquo; Unable to stand the confused agony of shapeless terrors, he closed his eyes and became unconscious.</description>

      <description>POOR Dasaratha was in extreme agony, pulled by natural affection on one side and by the moral obligation to fulfil a pledge on the other. He had fondly hoped that Kaikeyi would relent and that somehow the conflict of duties would be resolved. But now he saw that this was not to be. He had still one faint hope: &amp;ldquo;Rama is in no way bound by my promises and pledges. Strong as he is in people&amp;rsquo;s love and in his peerless prowess, he may disregard my promise, and stand on his own rights.</description>

      <description>RAMA went to Queen Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s dwelling. Many visitors were assembled there, eagerly awaiting the coronation. In the innermost apartment, the Queen, clad in white silk, was before the sacrificial fire invoking blessings on her son. As soon as Rama entered, she embraced him and showed him, who she thought, was to become the Yuvaraja, to a specially raised seat. &amp;ldquo;Mother, this seat is now too high for me,&amp;rdquo; said Rama. &amp;ldquo;I am a hermit and should sit on grass spread on the floor.</description>

      <description>What took place in the inner apartments of the palace was not yet known to the town-people. But Rama for his part lost no time in preparing for forest life. He went to Queen Kausalya to receive her blessings before leaving the city. Kausalya said to him again: &amp;ldquo;How can I stay in Ayodhya after you are gone? It is best that I go with you to the forest.&amp;rdquo; Of course, she knew that her duty was to serve her husband in his old age and share his sorrow in Ayodhya.</description>

      <description>AFTER Rama left his father&amp;rsquo;s presence with these words, the stricken King lay prostrated in speechless sorrow, and it was some time before he could muster his faculties sufficiently even to think. When he recovered some strength, he muttered half unconsciously: &amp;ldquo;Surely I must in a previous birth have inflicted hideous suffering to loving hearts. I must have torn calves from their mothers, children from their parents, husbands from their wives.</description>

      <description>The citizens who had slept on the bank of the Tamasa woke up in the morning and looked round. They were surprised to see that Rama and the chariot had disappeared. They followed the track of the chariot-wheels but were disappointed to find that it was lost in the main road to the capital. They returned home to their own houses and sought satisfaction in reviling Kaikeyi. Without Rama, the city was bereft of beauty and wrapt in gloom.</description>

      <description>Rama spent the night in Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s ashrama. Getting up in the morning, they paid their respects to the Maharishi and, taking leave of him, set out for the Chitrakuta hill. The muni treated them affectionately as if they were his own children and sent them forth with his blessings after explaining to them the way they should take through the forest. The three followed his topographical instructions closely and in due course came upon the river Kalindi.</description>

      <description>Sumantra and Guha stood watching the three figures as long as they could. When they disappeared from sight, they were plunged in sorrow and went back to Guha&amp;rsquo;s town. After a while Sumantra returned to Ayodhya. As the charioteer approached the city, he found it desolate and devoid of the usual cheerful bustle of urban life. Assoon as he crossed the fortress-gate and entered the city, his chariot was surrounded by a crowd eagerly asking: &amp;ldquo;Where did you leave Rama?</description>

      <description>Dasaradha had been driven ruthlessly by circumstances to an action which not only broke his heart but made him hate himself and deprived him even of self- pity. The only way out of the dilemma of either breaking his plighted word or doing a great wrong to Rama would have been for the latter to disobey him and insist on his rights. But Rama placed his duty to his father high above all other things.</description>

      <description>Dasaratha continued: &amp;ldquo;Listen, I shall tell you what followed. Having committed a sin and seeing the young ascetic die, I stood wondering what-to do next. Finally I decided that it was my duty and my interest to do what he advised me. I cleaned the pitcher, and filling it with fresh water, took it and went along the footpath he had pointed out. I reached his cottage and there I saw the old couple waiting for the return of their son.</description>

      <description>Kausalya clung to the King&amp;rsquo;s body and cried: &amp;ldquo;I shall go with the King to Yama&amp;rsquo;s abode. How can I live without my son and without my husband?&amp;rdquo; The elders and officers of the palace managed to separate her from the dead King and take her away. Then they discussed about the funeral rites. They could not be performed immediately, for Rama and Lakshmana had gone to the forest and Bharata and Satrughna were far away in their uncle&amp;rsquo;s place.</description>

      <description>Now Bharata understood everything and realised the enormity of the harm wrought by his mother. Overwhelmed by grief and near, he could not control himself. At the thought of what she had done and the eternal infamy she had incurred, his grief grew wild and he hurled cruel words at her. &amp;ldquo;What have you done?&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;Did you ever hope to make me accept the kingdom? Deprived of such a father and such a brother, am I likely to care for power?</description>

      <description>GAZING across the river Ganga, Guha, the hunter-king, noticed unusual commotion on the bank opposite. A great army had encamped there. He pointed it to his kinsmen standing by his side and said: &amp;ldquo;Who is this and why has he come here with a large army, apparently to cross the river? The flag suggests that it is Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s son Bharata and his army. Yes, I see the flag flying on the top of the chariot and I can recognise the tree painted on it.</description>

      <description>WHILE Bharata was thus engaged in trying to undo the mischief wrought by others, in the forest hut at Chitrakuta, life went on fairly cheerfully. With Lakshmana and Sita by his side, Rama lacked nothing. The grandeur of the mountain scenery and the forest and the sweet songs and play of the birds pleased his heart. He forgot the sorrow of his exile from kinsfolk and city. &amp;ldquo;Look, Sita, at those birds playing,&amp;rdquo; he would say.</description>

      <description>WHEN it was known that the four princes and the three queens were reunited and could be seen together in one place, a chorus of joy went up in the army and retinue and they came surging forward to witness that happy spectacle. They were sure now that Rama would return to Ayodhya and the people embraced one another for the very joy. The sage Vasishtha conducted the three queens to the hut.</description>

      <description>NOT far from Chitrakuta was an outpost of the Rakshasas, called Janasthana, in charge of a famous warrior named Khara, who was a brother of Ravana. From this station, fierce Rakshasas ranged the forest round, molesting the rishis in their isolated ashramas. They made life so insecure that the rishis abandoned their hermitages in the Chitrakuta region in spite of all that Rama could do to dissuade them. After Bharata&amp;rsquo;s departure Rama was not quite happy in Chitrakuta.</description>

      <description>Now begins the Aranya Kanda. The poet begins with an episode that prepares us for the misfortunes of Sita. A new responsibility has been cast on the prince. He is to destroy rakshasas who molest the rishis in the Dandaka forest. A fear arose in Sita&amp;rsquo;s heart like a shadow cast by events to come. &amp;ldquo;Why should you and Lakshmana who are properly to be merely ascetics in the forest&amp;rdquo; asked Sita of her beloved husband, &amp;ldquo;take on yourselves this task of protection?</description>

      <description>THE Princes and Sita, following Agastya&amp;rsquo;s instruction, took the way to Panchavati. On the way they met a huge figure perched on a big tree. They took it to be a Rakshasa. &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; asked Rama in an angry tone. The vulture however answered in a voice full of mildness and affection: &amp;ldquo;My child, I am your father&amp;rsquo;s aged friend.&amp;rdquo; Then he proceeded to tell his story. Jatayu was the brother of Sampati, the son of Aruna the dawn-god, who was brother to Garuda the great eagle-vehicle of Vishnu.</description>

      <description>RAMA and Lakshmana drove out Surpanakha, as one takes a stick and drives out a donkey straying into a garden. Such is the brief and simple treatment of this incident by Valmiki. Kamban, the Tamil poet, however, deals with it more elaborately and has made a number of changes in the story. Sitting on the riverbank, Rama watched a swan walking and then looked at Sita, also walking. Noting the similarity in the gait, Rama was pleased and smiled.</description>

      <description>ACCOMPANIED by the fourteen generals of Khara, Surpanakha came back to Rama&amp;rsquo;s ashrama, determined to avenge herself and drink the blood of the princes. Pointing to the two young men, she told her escort, &amp;ldquo;Look, there stand the men who insulted and mutilated me. Slay them immediately.&amp;rdquo; Rama understood the situation at once and told Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;Take care of Sita for a while, while I deal with those fellows.&amp;rdquo; Saying this, he took up his bow.</description>

      <description>AKAMPANA, one of the few Rakshasas who survived the great slaughter at Panchavati, fled to Lanka and seeking audience of Ravana, said: &amp;ldquo;Almost all our people who occupied Janasthana are dead and Janasthana is now an empty ruin. I alone have managed to escape with life.&amp;rdquo; Ravana was furious with anger. He stared and violently shouted: &amp;ldquo;Who destroyed my lovely Janasthana? Was it Yama or Agni or Vishnu?

Flattery is ever pleasant to the ears. Those who utter good though unpalatable advice are few; and fewer still are those who welcome it when given. Yet it is my duty to speak to you the harsh truth. Sweet words might please you now, but will surely lead you to danger and ruin.</description>

Trembling like a plantain tree in a storm, she cried: &amp;ldquo;There, Lakshmana, do you not hear your brother&amp;rsquo;s voice? Run, run at once to his help!&amp;rdquo; Overwhelmed by fear and seeing Lakshmana unwilling to move, she appealed to Lakshmana again and again in an agony of anxiety: &amp;ldquo;I hear my Lord&amp;rsquo;s voice in distress.

You boasted of your fame andyour great origin and your warlike qualities, but have you behaved like a brave warrior? Are you not ashamed of yourself? What sort of warrior is he who waits for the husband&amp;rsquo;s absence to steal his wife and carries off a lonely helpless woman when no one is nearer to prevent it?</description>

      <description>THE two brothers searched every mountain, forest and riverbank calling Sita&amp;rsquo;s name aloud. But all in vain, and they did not so much as find a clue anywhere. Baffled and grief-stricken, Rama cried out against the river Godavari, against the gods and against the five elements. The poet sage ascribes the silence of the rivers and the gods and elements to their fear of the powerful Rakshasa king. A herd of deer, however, moving southwards seemed to indicate to Rama and Lakshmana that they too should travel in the same direction.</description>

      <description>IN face of the unexpected difficulties that overtook them one after another, Rama and Lakshmana often lost heart. Their fortitude yielded place sometimes to great despair. But they managed to encourage each other and proceeded on their way. Passing through the forest, the two princes were suddenly caught by a tremendously big Rakshasa of ugly form without head or feet. His mouth was in his great belly and he had two enormous arms which, without moving from his place, he would stretch out and clutch tiger, bear or any other living thing within reach, and swallow them.</description>

      <description>THEN Sugriva heard the story of the calamity that had befallen the Raghu princes at Panchavati and how Rama&amp;rsquo;s heart was breaking with the ache of separation from Sita and anxiety as to her fate. Deeply touched, Sugriva tried to console Rama. &amp;ldquo;I have heard everything from Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Lay aside all doubts and fears. We shall surely discover Sita, wherever she may be concealed, and that, soon. My companions and myself noticed a Rakshasa carrying a weeping lady and speeding fast across the sky.</description>

      <description>SUGRIVA was keen on regaining his kingdom and family, but he could not see how this was to be. Vali&amp;rsquo;s strength stood as an impossible barrier between him and the fulfilment of his desire. Hanuman, his minister, tried to convince him that is would succeed with Rama&amp;rsquo;s help, but Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s doubts persisted. Could Rama&amp;rsquo;s strength overcome Vali&amp;rsquo;s? It all looked hopelessly impossible. Vali&amp;rsquo;s body was like steel. How was Rama going to kill him?</description>

      <description>EVENING was approaching. Once more Sugriva roared at the gate of Kishkindha and challenged Vali to fight. Vali who was then resting happily was startled and for a moment paled with puzzled concern, but was presently overwhelmed with rage and sprung stamping the earth as though he would split it. Tara, his queen, her heart full of loving fear, held him in arms in a close embrace and tried to restrain his impetuosity with affectionate counsel.</description>

      <description>THERE was panic in Kishkindha when the news came that Vali had been slain by an archer, and the Vanaras fled hither and thither in hopeless confusion. Tara, seeing this, laid aside her own grief and like a queen put courage in her husband&amp;rsquo;s subjects saying: &amp;ldquo;Till this day you walked before the King to battle! Why, then do you flee in fear now? There is no danger for you. Rama killed Vali only to make Sugriva king.</description>

      <description>THE rainy season began. Sugriva and his companions spent the time in Kishkindha in enjoyment but Rama and Lakshmana spent the weary days waiting in a cave nearby. The forest paths were flooded and became rushing torrents, impossible to traverse. The search for Sita, therefore, had to be suspended. Rama brooded over Sita&amp;rsquo;s predicament and was plunged in sorrow. Lakshmana counselled him to bear with the delay till the rainy season ended.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;LOOK, Rama, at this Vanara army,&amp;rdquo; said Sugriva. &amp;ldquo;All these myriads, of wondrous strength, are yours to command. They are willing and able to do you all the service you demand. Consider this huge army as your own and bid them to do whatever you wish.&amp;rdquo; Rama, beside himself with joy; embraced Sugriva. He said: &amp;ldquo;First we should find out whether Sita is alive, and if so where she is. Next we should know Ravana&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts.</description>

      <description>FROM Sampati the Vanaras learnt the place where Sita was kept a prisoner in the land of the Rakshasa, a hundred yojanas across the ocean. But of course it would not do to return to Sugriva at once with this second-hand information. They had outstayed the allotted time and only outstanding success could save them from punishment. They could not stop their search till they saw with their own eyes what Sampati had described only then could they fulfil Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose.</description>

      <description>FULL of hope, Hanuman alighted and set foot in Lanka. But soon the flush of triumph at the accomplishment of the journey gave place to sober thinking. &amp;ldquo;True I have crossed the sea, but that is only the beginning of my mission. There, on mount Trikuta, stands Ravana&amp;rsquo;s magnificent city, as if suspended in the sky. How beautiful, how wealthy, how well secured it is! The city and the fortress are not inferior to Amaravati or Bhagavati.</description>

It was the invisible atmosphere which envelopes an accomplished mission and influences subtly the devoted heart. As be had at last reached the spot where Sita was, his whole being throbbed with exulting expectation without any apparent reason. It was an early spring night. Trees and plants were in flowers. Hanuman jumped to a place where there was a thick cluster of trees.</description>

      <description>TO SITA, plunged in a sea of sorrow and clinging to dharma and to the thought of her lord, Ravana spoke these words: &amp;ldquo;O beautiful one! Why do you shrink from me? Do you not see how much I care for you? Though it is lawful for a Rakshasa to take another&amp;rsquo;s wife and possess her by force, I am a beggar for your love. There is no need to fear me.</description>

      <description>THE boldest and most strong-minded woman may, if kept in captivity for a long period, lose heart and become depressed. Sita hoped month after month that her lord would discover her whereabouts and come to her rescue. Sick with disappointed hope, alone in the midst of enemies, she clung to life only from an abiding faith in the love of Rama that made her feel that he would surely come. The Rakshasis plied her with what from their point of view was well-meant counsel.</description>

      <description>HIDDEN by the branches, Hanuman sang in a sweet and gentle voice the story of Rama so that it fell on Sita&amp;rsquo;s ears: &amp;ldquo;King Dasaratha ruled his kingdom well. His army was mighty and comprisedof chariots, elephants and horses. He was virtuous and a doer of great deeds. He kept his word and was foremost among the famous kings of the world. He was equal to the rishis in virtue and to Indra in statesmanship.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DEAR, dear Vanara friend,&amp;rdquo; said Sita, &amp;ldquo;I do not know whether to rejoice or grieve at the news you have brought. Your words are like nectar mixed with poison. My lord&amp;rsquo;s love for me is sweetest nectar, and his grief over my plight is bitterest poison.&amp;rdquo; Thus Sita spoke what she felt and found comfort in putting in words her love and her grief. Pleasure and pain, happiness and misery alternately impel human beings.</description>

      <description>AFTER taking leave of Sita, Hanuman sat for a while on the top of the garden wall and began to think: &amp;ldquo;What can I do to put courage into Sita and some fear into Ravana and his friends to shake their arrogant confidence? It would be good to leave them some souvenir of my visit, some indication of what the future has in store for them. It is clear I must instill some fear into Ravana to prevent him from troubling Sita in the meantime.</description>

You have come, have you?&amp;rdquo; he said and, jumping down, brandished his tail, and striking the ground with it, roared till the four quarters shook. He snatched the huge iron bar from the gate and, armed with this weapon, began to attack them all.</description>

Who can put up in a different tongue Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s poetry describing the beauty of forests and the terrible fury of encounters between warriors? The rhythm and grandeur of his words convey the terror and majesty of what he describes. This power is Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s special gift. We can only summarise in pedestrian prose his glowing account, of the battle between Aksha, the beloved son of Ravana, and Hanuman.</description>

Forgetting the pain and insults he had borne, Hanuman gazed with wrathful curiosity at the giant monarch. As he gazed at him resplendent on his throne a sort of pitying admiration of the doomed Rakshasa entered his thoughts. Clad in silk of golden hue, with the royal crown on his head, the jewels inlaid in it shining brilliantly, Ravana sat there, a figure of dazzling splendor.</description>

      <description>Now let us leave Rama and his host here and go back to Ravana. Great poets in all languages delineate with sympathy even their bad characters allowing gleams of goodness to shine through occasionally, for nature has not made anybody wholly and unredeemably evil. The poet&amp;rsquo;s aim is to direct the reader&amp;rsquo;s mind into the path of good, the satvik way. For this purpose they use all their skill and power in developing even their rajasik and tamasik characters.</description>

His brother&amp;rsquo;s welfare demanded that he should seek somehow to convert and save him. Vibhishana entered the royal palace and stood with folded hands before the king. Ravana sent away all but the principal Ministers and asked his brother to speak. &amp;ldquo;My brother and my lord,&amp;rdquo; began Vibhishana, &amp;ldquo;forgive me if what I say is not pleasing to your ears.</description>

If you had any grievance against Rama and Lakshmana, you should have met them face to face and defeated and slain them before carrying off Sita. If you had acted thus, even Sita would have admired you and there would then have been a possibility of her accepting you.</description>

Many spoke flattering words. Only two spoke harshly. One said: &amp;ldquo;You have committed a fault. But I will give up my life for you.&amp;rdquo; This was Kumbhakarna. The other, Vibhishana, said: &amp;ldquo;You have committed a sin, but there is still time for repentance and escape from consequences.</description>

Not even Brihaspati has anything to tell you that you do not already know. If it is dangerous to admit Vibhishana, how is the danger met by delay and trial? Where is the time or opportunity for a test? More over, Vibhishana has not approached us stealthily. He has come to us with frank openness and a clear object.</description>

This Rakshasa, Suka by name, flew across and in disguise met Sugriva in secret and with every appearance of benevolent solicitude spoke to him thus: &amp;ldquo;Ravana, the king of Lanka, has sent me because of his affection and regard for you. He sends you his fraternal greetings. You are a king and he is another and there is no sense in your staking your high heritage and making common cause with a disinherited prince against an all- powerful king.</description>

      <description>THE Vanara army descended from Mount Suvela and entered the forest adjoining the city of Lanka. As the army burst in like a flood the frightened beasts and birds in the forest fled in all directions. Valmiki describes the scene and the event in his characteristic style. Gazing now from below at the mountain fortress and the divinely beautiful city constructed by Viswakarma, Rama was again filled with wonder and exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Oh what beauty!</description>

      <description>SUKA, the Rakshasa scout, went and reported to Ravana: &amp;ldquo;I did my job according to your instructions. But my efforts were fruitless. They were rough with me and made me feel thankful to be allowed to come back. Rama, to whom it was sport to slay Viradha, Kabandha, Khara and others, has arrived with the army of Sugriva. They have somehow come to know of the place where Sita is held captive.</description>

      <description>RAVANA as duly informed that Rama&amp;rsquo;s Vanara host surrounded Lanka like a tumultuous sea. In an angry mood he went up the tower of his mansion and surveyed the scene. On every side he saw Vanara warriors who had armed themselves with trees and boulders. He wondered how he could destroy this vast invading force. At the same time, Rama saw the City of Lanka guarded by the Rakshasas. He could see with his mind&amp;rsquo;s eye the sad figure of Sita held captive within those walls.</description>

      <description>RAVANA from within his palace was surprised to hear, borne on the wind, the jubilant acclamations of the Vanaras, who he thought must then be mourning their vanquished leaders and slaughtered comrades. He turned to the Rakshasas standing beside him and asked: &amp;ldquo;What has happened to make the Vanaras so happy? Something strange must have occurred. Go and find out what it is.&amp;rdquo; Some Rakshasas climbed up and looked over the wall.</description>

      <description>WHEN Ravana returned humbled and dejected, the gods rejoiced foreseeing the speedy end of their troubles. Ravana entered the fortress, ashamed and anxious. After deliberating a while, he recovered his courage and ordered his sleeping brother Kumbhakarna to be roused. As the result of a curse, Kumbhakarna used to sleep for months together and he had gone to sleep just a few days before the events last narrated. Ravana asked his ministers to spare no efforts to rouse Kumbhakarna at once and get him ready for battle.</description>

      <description>RALLIED by Angada, the Vanaras recovered courage, reformed in battle order and prepared to receive Kumbhakarna. They hurled rocks at him and dealt heavy blows with trees plucked by the roots. But he disregarded them all and with a smile on his face went on dispatching the Vanaras with a methodic cruelty that was most terrifying. Some of them retreated to the newly built dam, while others tried to save themselves by concealing on the shore of the sea and the forests.</description>

      <description>INDRAJIT comforted his father. &amp;ldquo;Why should you worry when I am here alive?&amp;rdquo; he said and gathered an army, and with it made another sortie. He swooped down on the Vanara forces and killed and wounded thousands of them. They were helpless against his fury. The Brahmastra of Indrajit was effective against even Rama and Lakshmana who were tied up by it. They lay unconscious on the ground and the Rakshasa prince went straight to his anxious father with the glad news of this achievement.</description>

      <description>THERE was wailing in every house in Lanka. In Ravana&amp;rsquo;s breast grief, shame and anger seethed like a raging sea. He had so far sent his commanders and men in detachments, and, brave as they were, they had been destroyed in detail. This had been the result of overweening confidence in his invincibility and contempt for the enemy, most of whom fought with no better weapons than sticks and stones. But repeated reverses had brought him no wisdom.</description>

      <description>VIBHISHANA was crowned King of Lanka in a magnificent ceremony. The new Lord of Lanka came out to the Vanara camp and bowed low before Rama. Then Rama said to Hanuman: &amp;ldquo;With the King&amp;rsquo;s permission, enter Lanka and tell Sita what has happened.&amp;rdquo; Hanuman accordingly took permission from Vibhishana and went to Asoka Vana to convey the news to Sita. Sita&amp;rsquo;s joy was beyond words. She was silent. &amp;ldquo;Why, mother,&amp;rdquo; asked Hanuman, &amp;ldquo;why do you not speak?</description>

I said: &amp;ldquo;How did she get all these ideas and phrases of love without having read any of present-day love stories?&amp;rdquo; Gandhiji said in answer: &amp;ldquo;But has she not read the Ramayana? Is the Ramayana not a love story too?&amp;rdquo; This struck me as profound. Then we turned to other matters. Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s troubles began with love.</description>

      <description>Author: Saiswaroopa @Sai_swaroopa
Day 01 Could record two general battles and 26 duels on Day One. Only 6 of those duels ended decisively. Pandava side suffered horribly in the hands of Bhishma. Uttara killed in the hands of Shalya. Saving grace being Abhimanyu countering Bhishma and winning over Brihadbala. Another highlight is the maternal grandfather of the Pandavas, Kuntibhoja successfully repelling Vinda-Anuvinda of Avanti and the sons of Draupadi excelling. Still Bhishma was so terrible that the Pandava side had to withdraw as soon as the sun set.</description>

      <description>A sub-set of the smarta brahmins of Gingee, Melaccheri Kadu and parts of the modern Telugu country upwards of Kalahasti, usually belonging to the great sect of bR^ihatcharaNaM or rarely the vaDamas (northerners), are called pAratiyAr-s. There are other pAratiyAr-s belonging the middle caste vELALar-s. Both of them are associated with the draupadi ammAL temples of the region, whose many patrons are vanniyar-s. The vanniyar-s are described by some as shUdra or avarNa, but their and internal beliefs point to the possibility that they were actually vahni-kula rAjaputra-s.</description>

      <description>“Hindus have no historical sense”; “India is a cul de sac”; “upaniShads and the buddha were contemporaneous and had Greek influence”. I heard all this gibberish and more from my school textbooks and leftist colleagues. I had long back silently noticed the precision with which Hindus recorded dates on their stone and copper plate inscriptions, be it Sanskrit or a regional dialect. This immediately brought home to me in a flash that the white scholars and their fellow-travellers were looking for Hindu historicity in the wrong places.</description>

Having obtained several manuscripts of various Indic texts in Central Asia he moved further ahead on horse to make a rendezvous with his Mongolian guide. Having mounted a fresh horse and penetrated deep into the steppes they arrived after a week at the remote outposts of what was once the organizing ground of the great Oirat emperors, Esen Taiji and Amasanji Taiji.</description>

      <description>I use the hybrid Greek-Sanskrit word para-rāmāyāṇa for all rāma-kathā-s other than that of Vālmīki. These span a great diversity of literature going back to relatively early times in Indo-Aryan tradition. Lots of people have said a lot of things on this matter and we are hardly going to review any of that here. The Rāmāyaṇa itself is enigmatic in some ways. There is no allusion to the main characters of the epic in the Vedic corpus just like the central pāṇḍu heroes of the Mahābhārata.</description>

      <description>The jainas possess some interesting divergent variants of the canonical Indo-Aryan myths. The harivaMsha of jinasena and the triShaShThisalakapuruSha charita of hemachandra is a rather rich source for such mythic material. The jaina view postulated the existance of 63 salakapuruShas or notable figures who are like spokes in the wheel of time. Not unexpectedly the 63 includes the 24 tirthankaras. Other than these there are 12 chakravartins who start with the great bhArata.</description>

      <description>While the bhArata epic is a central to understanding the rise of the Indian state and the very culture of the Indian people, there are some mysterious issues associated with it which still leave a major gap in understanding this historical period. At its heart the epic represents the expansion of the kuru-pA~nchAla realm over the whole of Northern India, establish a unified administrative and cultural zone. The sequence of events leading to this as painted in the mbh are thus: 1) We have the rise of the bhAratas under their eponymous founder the great conqueror bharata daushyanti who raises this line of the pUru kShatriya clan to prominence and pre-eminent rulers amongst the Indo-Aryans.</description>

      <description>I believe that despite all the noise on the topics the purANas are at this point more enlightening on certain points than all the archaeology of the Indian subcontinent. In fact it appears important that the future archaeological studies in India, if they occur at all, must keep in the mind the Pauranic timelines for poorly known Hindu dynasties. At the outset I must make it clear that some well-known dates contested recently by Hindu historical revisionists are indeed correct.</description>

This note may be read as part of our studies on the Rāmāyaṇa and para-Rāmāyaṇa-s of which an earlier part is presented here.
A study of the epic in Indo-European tradition suggests that there were two registers of the old Indo-European religion. While today both of them survive together with any vigor only among the Hindus, until not too long ago these registers showed some survival even among their Iranian cousins.</description>

Our clanswoman had obtained a detailed account of the itihAsa of irAvAn from one of the most learned smArta bhAratiyAr-s of that locality whose clan was associated with that of our ancestors for a while. Of course the smArta narrative differs quite drastically from the narratives of the tevar and other tamil pAratiyAr-s.</description>

      <description>We earlier described the major problem termed the bhArata conundrum, where we notice a silence regarding the pANDavas alone in the vedic textual layers, but they are prominently mentioned in all the later texts of Sanskrit and prakrit literature. The following plausible theories may be cited in this regard:
1) The vedic authors were of the kaurava party and hence purposely omitted references to the pANDus. The main problem with this theory is why do they mention the descendents of the pANDava-s as per the great epic in very positive light.</description>

      <description>The below comments by the revered mAnasatarangiNIkAra throw light on the connection between niyoga and ashvamedha – with particular reference to the birth of rAma. Also note ancillary remarks about how the epics can be interpreted as mirrors of the shruti; and how besides that, they must be read at many levels. And note the (very credible) theory that the current rAmAyaNa is a vaiShNava recasting of an aindra epic.</description>
