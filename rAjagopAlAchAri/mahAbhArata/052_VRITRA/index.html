  <p>INDRA, the Lord of the three regions,
was once so drunk with pride that he quite
forgot the courteous manners and forms
that the gods had hitherto observed.
When Brihaspati, preceptor of the gods,
foremost in all branches of learning, and
venerated alike by the gods and the
asuras, came to his court, Indra did not
rise from his seat to receive the acharya or
ask him to be seated and failed to do the
customary honors.
In his great conceit, Indra persuaded
himself to believe that the sastras allowed
him as a king in court the prerogative of
receiving guests seated. Brihaspati was
hurt by Indra&rsquo;s discourtesy and, attributing
it to the arrogance of prosperity, silently
left the assembly.
Without the high priest of the gods, the
court lost in splendor and dignity and
became an unimpressive gathering.
Indra soon realized the foolishness of his
conduct and, sensing trouble for himself
from the acharya&rsquo;s displeasure, he thought
to make up with him by falling at his feet
and asking for forgiveness.
But this he could not do, because
Brihaspati had, in his anger, made himself
invisible. This preyed on Indra&rsquo;s mind.
With Brihaspati gone, Indra&rsquo;s strength
began to decline, while that of the asuras
increased, which encouraged the latter to
attack the gods. Then Brahma, taking pity
on the beleaguered gods, advised them to
take unto themselves a new acharya.
Said he to them: &ldquo;You have, through
Indra&rsquo;s folly, lost Brihaspati. Go now to
Twashta&rsquo;s son Visvarupa and request that
noble spirit to be your preceptor and all
will be well with you.&rdquo;
Heartened by these words, the gods
sought the youthful anchorite Visvarupa
and made their request to him saying:
&ldquo;Though young in years, you are well
versed in the Vedas. Do us the honor of
being our teacher.&rdquo;
Visvarupa agreed, to the great advantage
of the gods for, as a result of his guidance
and teaching, they were saved from the
tormenting asuras.
Visvarupa&rsquo;s, mother was of the asura clan
of daityas, which caused Indra to regard
Visvarupa with suspicion. He feared that
because of his birth, Visvarupa might not
be quite loyal and his suspicion gradually
deepened.
Apprehending danger to himself from this
descendent of the enemies of the gods,
Indra sought to entice him into error with
the temptresses of his court and so weaken
him spiritually. But Visvarupa did not
succumb.
The artful and seductive blandishments of
Indra&rsquo;s glamour girls had no effect on the
young ascetic. He held fast to his vow of
celibacy. When Indra found that his plan
of seduction failed, he gave way to
murderous thoughts and one day killed
Visvarupa with the Vajrayudha.
The story goes that the world suffers
vicariously for this great sin of Indra.
And, as a result of it, parts of the earth
turned alkaline and became unsuitable for
cultivation and women came to be
afflicted with the physical troubles and
uncleanness peculiar to them. The
frothing of water is also attributed to this.
Twashta in his great rage and grief at
Indra&rsquo;s cruel killing of his son and,
desirous of avenging his death, performed
a great sacrifice. And out of the sacrificial
flames sprang Indra&rsquo;s mortal enemy
Vritra.
Twashta sent him against the chief of the
gods, saying: &ldquo;Enemy of Indra, may you
be strong and may you kill Indra.&rdquo; A great
battle raged between the two in which
Vritra was gaining the upper hand.
When the battle was going against Indra,
the rishis and the gods sought refuge in
great Vishnu who offered them protection
and said to them: &ldquo;Be not afraid. I shallenter Indra&rsquo;s Vajrayudha and he will win
the battle in the end.&rdquo; And they returned in
good heart.
They went to Vritra and said to him:
&ldquo;Please make friends with Indra. You are
both equal in strength and valor.&rdquo;
Vritra
respectfully
answered:
&ldquo;O
blameless ones, how can Indra, and I
become friends? Forgive me. There
cannot be friendship between rivals for
supremacy. Two great powers cannot
coexist as you know.&rdquo;
The rishis said in reply: &ldquo;Do not entertain
such doubts. Two good souls can be
friends and their friendship is often after
hostility.&rdquo;
Vritra yielded saying: &ldquo;Well, then, I shall
cease fighting. But I have no faith in
Indra. He might take me unawares. So I
seek this boon of you, namely, that neither
by day nor by night, neither with dry
weapons nor with wet ones, neither with
stone nor with wood, nor with metals, nor
with arrows shall Indra be able to take my
life.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said the rishis and the gods.
Hostilities ceased. But soon Vritra&rsquo;s fears
were confirmed. Indra only feigned
friendship for Vritra but was, all the time,
waiting for a suitable opportunity to slay
him.
One evening, he met Vritra on the beach
and began to attack him in the twilight.
The battle had raged for a long while
when Vritra praising the Lord Vishnu,
said to Indra: &ldquo;Meanest of the mean, why
do you not use the unfailing Vajrayudha?
Hallowed by Hari, use it against me and I
shall attain blessedness through Hari.&rdquo;
Indra maimed Vritra by chopping off his
right arm but, undaunted, the latter hurled
with his left band, his iron mace at his
assailant who thereupon cut down his
other arm also. When Indra disappeared
into the mouth of Vritra, great was the
consternation of the gods.
But Indra was not dead. He ripped Vritra&rsquo;s
belly open and issuing forth went to the
nearby
beach.
And
directing
his
thunderbolt at the water hurled it so that
the surf flew and hit Vritra. Vishnu having
entered the foam, it became a deadly
weapon and the mighty Vritra lay dead.
The long battle thus ended and the
afflicted world heaved a sigh of relief. But
to Indra himself, the end of the war
brought only ignominy because his
victory was secured through sin and deceit
and is went into hiding for sheer shame.
Indra&rsquo;s disappearance caused the gods and
the rishis great distress. For a people
without a king or a council of state to
govern them cannot prosper. So they went
to the good and mighty king Nahusha and
offered him the crown.
&ldquo;Forgive me, I cannot be your king. Who
am I to aspire to the seat of Indra? How
can I protect you? It is impossible,&rdquo; he
humbly objected. But they insisted,
saying: &ldquo;Do not hesitate. Be anointed our
king. All the merit and potency of our
penance will be yours and be an addition
to your strength. The power and the
energy of everyone you set your eyes on
shall be transferred to you and you will be
invincible.&rdquo;
Thus
over-powered,
he
agreed. Revolution is no new thing. This
story shows that, even in the world of the
gods, there was a revolution leading to
Indra&rsquo;s dethronement and Nahusha&rsquo;s
installation as king in his stead. The story
of Nahusha&rsquo;s fall is also instructive.</p>
