  <p>EMPEROR Yayati was one of the
ancestors of the Pandavas. He had never
known defeat. He followed the dictates of
the sastras, adored the gods and venerated
his ancestors with intense devotion. He
became famous as a ruler devoted to the
welfare of his subjects.
But as has already been told, he became
prematurely old by the curse of
Sukracharya for having wronged his wife
Devayani. In the words of the poet of the
Mahabharata:
&ldquo;Yayati attained that old age which
destroys beauty and brings on miseries.&rdquo; It
is needless to describe the misery of youth
suddenly blighted into age, where the
horrors of loss are accentuated by pangs
of recollection.
Yayati, who found himself suddenly an
old man, was still haunted by the desire
for sensual enjoyment. He had five
beautiful
sons,
all
virtuous
and
accomplished. Yayati called them and
appealed piteously to their affection:
&ldquo;The
curse
of
your
grandfather
Sukracharya has made me unexpectedly
and prematurely old. I have not had my
fill of the joys of life. For, not knowing
what was in store for me I lived a life of
restraint, denying myself even lawful
pleasures. One of you ought to bear the
burden of my old age and give his youth
in return. He who agrees to this and
bestows his youth on me will be the ruler
of my kingdom. I desire to enjoy life in
the full vigor of youth.&rdquo;
He first asked his eldest son. That son
replied: &ldquo;O great king, women and
servants will mock at me if I were to take
upon myself your old age. I cannot do go.
Ask of my younger brothers who are
dearer to you than myself.&rdquo;
When the second son was approached, he
gently refused with the words: &ldquo;Father,
you ask me to take up old age thatdestroys not only strength and beauty but
also as I see wisdom. I am not strong
enough to do so.&rdquo;
The third son replied: &ldquo;An old man cannot
ride a horse or an elephant. His speech
will falter. What can I do in such a
helpless plight? I cannot agree.&rdquo;
The king was angry and disappointed that
his three sons had declined to do as he
wished, but he hoped for better from his
fourth son, to whom he said: &ldquo;You should
take up my old age. If you exchange your
youth with me, I shall give it back to you
after some time and take back the old age
with which I have been cursed.&rdquo;
The fourth son begged to be forgiven as
this was a thing he could by no means
consent to. An old man had to seek the
help of others even to keep his body clean,
a most pitiful plight. No, much as he
loved his father he could not do it.
Yayati was struck with sorrow at the
refusal of the four sons. Still, hoping
against hope, he supplicated his last son
who had never yet opposed his wishes:
&ldquo;You must save me. I am afflicted with
this old age with its wrinkles, debility and
grey hairs as a result of the curse of
Sukracharya. It is too hard a trial! If you
will take upon yourself these infirmities, I
shall enjoy life for just a while more and
then give you back your youth and resume
my old age and all its sorrows. Pray, do
not refuse as your elder brothers have
done.&rdquo;
Puru, the youngest son, moved by filial
love, said: &ldquo;Father, I gladly give you my
youth and relieve you of the sorrows of
old age and cares of state. Be happy.&rdquo;
Hearing these words Yayati embraced
him. As soon as he touched his son,
Yayati became a youth. Puru, who
accepted the old age of his father, ruled
the kingdom and acquired great renown.
Yayati enjoyed life for long, and not
satisfied, went later to the garden of
Kubera and spent many years with an
Apsara maiden.
After long years spent in vain efforts to
quench desire by indulgence, the truth
dawned on him.
Returning to Puru, he said: &ldquo;Dear son,
sensual desire is never quenched by
indulgence any more than fire is by
pouring ghee in it. I had heard and read
this, but till now I had not realised it. No
object of desire, corn, gold, cattle or
women, nothing can ever satisfy the desire
of man, We can reach peace only by a
mental poise beyond likes and dislikes.
Such is the state of Brahman. Take back
your youth and rule the kingdom wisely
and well.&rdquo;
With these words Yayati took his old age.
Puru, who regained his youth, was made
king by Yayati who retired to the forest.
He spent his time there in austerities and,
in due course, attained heaven.</p>
