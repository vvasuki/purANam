      <description>BHAGAVAN VYASA, the celebrated compiler of the Vedas, was the son of the great sage Parasara. It was he who gave to the world the divine epic of the Mahabharata. Having conceived the Mahabharata he thought of the means of giving the sacred story to the world. He meditated on Brahma, the Creator, who manifestedhimself before him. Vyasa saluted him with bowed head and folded hands and prayed: &amp;ldquo;Lord, I have conceived an excellent work, but cannot think of one who can take it down to my dictation.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You must certainly become my wife, whoever you may be.&amp;rdquo; Thus said the great King Santanu to the goddess Ganga who stood before him in human form, intoxicating his senses with her superhuman loveliness. The king earnestly offered for her love his kingdom, his wealth, his all, his very life. Ganga replied: &amp;ldquo;O king, I shall become your wife. But on certain conditions that neither you nor anyone else should ever ask me who I am, or whence I come.</description>

      <description>WITH joy the king received to his heart and his kingdom the resplendent and youthful prince Devavrata and crowned him as the Yuvaraja, the heir apparent. Four years went by. One day as the king was wandering on the banks of the Yamuna, the air was suddenly filled with a fragrance so divinely sweet that the king sought for its cause, and he traced it to a maiden so lovely that she seemed a goddess.</description>

      <description>CHITRANGADA, the son of Satyavati, was killed in battle with a Gandharva. As he died childless, his brother, Vichitravirya, was the rightful heir and was duly crowned king. And as he was a minor, Bhishma governed the kingdom in his name till be came of age. When Vichitravirya reached adolescence Bhishma cast about for a bride for him. And as he heard that the daughters of the king of Kasi were to choose theirhusbands according to the ancient Kshatriya practice he went there to secure them for his brother.</description>

      <description>IN ancient times, there was a bitter struggle between the devas or gods and the asuras or demons for the lordship of the three worlds. Both belligerents had illustrious preceptors. Brihaspati who was pre-eminent in the knowledge of the Vedas was the guiding spirit of the devas, while the asuras relied on Sukracharya&amp;rsquo;s profound wisdom. The asuras had the formidable advantage that Sukracharya alone possessed the secret of Sanjivini which could recall the dead to life.</description>

      <description>ONE warm afternoon, pleasantly tired with sporting in the woods Devayani and the daughters of Vrishaparva, king of the asuras, went to bathe in the cool waters of a sylvan pool, depositing their garlands on the bank before they entered its waters. A strong breeze blew their clothes together into a huddled heap and when they came to take them up again, some mistakes naturally occurred. It so happened that princess Sarmishtha, the daughter of the king, clad herself in Devayani&amp;rsquo;s clothes.</description>

      <description>EMPEROR Yayati was one of the ancestors of the Pandavas. He had never known defeat. He followed the dictates of the sastras, adored the gods and venerated his ancestors with intense devotion. He became famous as a ruler devoted to the welfare of his subjects. But as has already been told, he became prematurely old by the curse of Sukracharya for having wronged his wife Devayani. In the words of the poet of the Mahabharata: &amp;ldquo;Yayati attained that old age which destroys beauty and brings on miseries.</description>

      <description>THE sage Mandavya who had acquired strength of mind and knowledge of the scriptures, spent his days in penance and the practice of truth.
He lived in a hermitage in the forests on the outskirts of the city. One day while he was immersed in silent contemplation under the shade of a tree outside his hut of leaves, a band of robbers fled through the woods with officers of the king in hot pursuit.</description>

      <description>SURA, the grandfather of Sri Krishna, was a worthy scion of the Yadava race. His daughter Pritha was noted for her beauty and virtues. Since his cousin Kuntibhoja was childless, Sura gave his daughter Pritha in adoption to him. From that time she was known by the name of Kunti after her adoptive father. When Kunti was a little girl, the sage Durvasa stayed for a time as a guest in her father&amp;rsquo;s house and she served the sage for a year with all care, patience and devotion.</description>

      <description>ONE day King Pandu was out hunting. A sage and his wife were also sporting in the forest in the guise of deer. Pandu shot the male with an arrow, in ignorance of the fact that it was a sage in disguise. Stricken to death the rishi thus cursed Pandu: &amp;ldquo;Sinner, you will meet with death the moment you taste the pleasures of the bed.&amp;rdquo; Pandu was heartbroken at this curse and retreated to the forest with his wives after entrusting his kingdom to Bhishma and Vidura and lived there a life of perfect abstinence.</description>

      <description>THE five sons of Pandu and the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra grew up in mirth and merriment at Hastinapura. Bhima excelled them all in physical prowess. He used to bully Duryodhana and the other Kauravas by dragging them by the hair and beating them. A great swimmer, he would dive, into pools, with one or more of them clasped helpless in his arms, and remain under water till they were almost drowned.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas and the Kauravas learnt the practice of arms first from Kripacharya and later from Drona. A day was fixed for a test and exhibition of their proficiency in the use of arms in the presence of the royal family and as the public had also been invited to witness the performance of their beloved princes. There was a large and enthusiastic crowd. Arjuna displayed superhuman skill with his weapons and the vast assemblage was lost in wonder and admiration.</description>

      <description>DRONA, the son of a brahmana named Bharadwaja, after completing his study of the Vedas and the Vedangas, devoted himself to the art of archery and became a great master.
Drupada, the son of the king of Panchala, who was a friend of Bharadwaja, was a fellow-student of Drona in the hermitage and there grew up between them the generous intimacy of youth.
Drupada, in his boyish enthusiasm, used often to tell Drona that he would give him half his kingdom when he ascended the throne.</description>

      <description>THE jealousy of Duryodhana began to grow at the sight of the physical strength of Bhima and the dexterity of Arjuna. Karna and Sakuni became Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s evil counsellors in planning wily stratagems. As for poor Dhritarashtra, he was a wise man no doubt and he also loved his brother&amp;rsquo;s sons, but he was weak of will and dotingly attached to his own children. For his children&amp;rsquo;s sake the worse became the better reason, and he would sometimes even knowingly follow the wrong path.</description>

      <description>AFTER taking reverential leave of the elders and embracing their comrades, the Pandavas proceeded to Varanavata. The citizens accompanied them a part of their way and returned unwillingly to the city. Vidura pointedly warned Yudhishthira in words intelligible only to the prince: &amp;ldquo;He alone will escape from danger who forestalls the intentions of an astute enemy. There are weapons sharper than those made of steel. And the wise man who would escape destruction must know the means to guard against them.</description>

      <description>IN the city of Ekachakra, the Pandavas stayed in the guise of brahmanas, begging their food in the brahmana streets and bringing what they got to their mother, who would wait anxiously till their return. If they did not come back in time, she would be worried, fearing that some evil might have befallen them. Kunti would divide the food they brought in two equal portions. One half would go to Bhima.</description>

      <description>WHILE the Pandavas were living in disguise as brahmanas at Ekachakrapura, news of the swayamvara of Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada, King of Panchala, reached them. Many brahmanas of Ekachakrapura planned to go to Panchala in the hope of receiving the customary gifts and to see the festivities and pageant of a royal wedding. Kunti, with her motherly instinct, read her sons&amp;rsquo; desire to go to Panchala and win Draupadi. So she told Yudhishthira: &amp;ldquo;We have been in this city so long that it is time to think of going somewhere else.</description>

      <description>WHEN news of the incidents that took place during the swayamvara at Panchala reached Hastinapura, Vidura was happy. He immediately went to Dhritarashtra and said: &amp;ldquo;O King, our family has become stronger because the daughter of Drupada has become our daughter-in-law. Our stars are good.&amp;rdquo; Dhritarashtra thought in his blind fondness for his son that it was Duryodhana, who had also gone to take part in the swayamvara, that had won Draupadi.</description>

      <description>IN the stories narrated in the Puranas, birds and beasts speak like men, and sometimes they give sound advice and even teach spiritual wisdom. But the natural qualities of those creatures are adroitly made to peep through this human veil. One of the characteristic beauties of the Puranic literature is this happy fusion of nature and imagination. In a delightful passage in the Ramayana, Hanuman, who is described as very wise and learned, is made to frolic with apish joy, when he imagined that the beautiful damsel he saw at Ravana&amp;rsquo;s inner courtyard was Sita.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas ruled Indraprastha in all glory. Those who surrounded Yudhishthira urged him to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice and assume the title of Emperor. It is evident that imperialism had an irresistible glamour even in those days. Yudhishthira sought Sri Krishna&amp;rsquo;s advice in this matter. When Krishna learnt that Dharmaputra desired to see him, he set out in a chariot harnessed with swift horses and reached Indraprastha. Yudhishthira said: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;My people urge me to perform Rajasuya, but as you know, only he who can secure the respect and allegiance of all kings, can perform that sacrifice and win the status of emperor.</description>

      <description>BRIHADRATHA, the commander of three regiments, reigned in the kingdom of Magadha and attained celebrity as a great hero. He married the twin daughters of the raja of Kasi and vowed to them that he would not show any partiality to either. Brihadratha was not blessed with a child for a long time. When he became old, he handed over his kingdom to his ministers, went to the forest with his two wives and engaged himself in austerities.</description>

      <description>THE practice of staging a walkout from an assembly in protest against something is nothing new. We learn from the Mahabharata that walkout was resorted to even in ancient times. The India of those days consisted of a number of independent states. Though there was one dharma and one culture throughout the land, the autonomy of each state was scrupulosly respected. Occasionally, some strong and ambitious monarch would seek the assent of his fellow kings to his overlordship, which would sometimes be given without question.</description>

      <description>AT the close of the Rajasuya, the princes, priests and elders, who had gathered for the purpose, took leave and returned to their places. Vyasa also came to say farewell. Dharmaputra rose and received him with due respect and sat by his side. The sage said: &amp;ldquo;O son of Kunti, you have got the title of emperor which you eminently deserve. May the illustrious Kuru race gain even greater glory through you.</description>

      <description>DURYODHANA and Sakuni went to Dhritarashtra. Sakuni opened the conversation. He said: &amp;ldquo;O king,Duryodhana is wan with grief and anxiety. You are paying no attention to his unbearable sorrow. Why this unconcern?&amp;rdquo; Dhritarashtra who doted on his son embraced Duryodhana and said: &amp;ldquo;I do not see why you should be disconsolate. What is here that you already do not enjoy? The whole world is at your feet. When you are surrounded by all kinds of pleasures like the very gods, why should you pine in sorrow?</description>

      <description>AT THE sight of Vidura, Yudhishthira anxiously inquired: &amp;ldquo;Why are you so cheerless? Is it well with all our relations in Hastinapura? Are the king and the princes well?&amp;rdquo; Vidura acquainted him with his mission: &amp;ldquo;Everyone in Hastinapura is well. How fares it with you all? I have come to invite you on behalf of King Dhritarashtra to come and see the newly erected hall of games. A beautiful hall has been erected there even like yours.</description>

      <description>PRATHIKAMI went to Draupadi as ordered by his master. He said to her: &amp;ldquo;O revered princess, Yudhishthira fell under the spell of the game of dice and has wagered and lost even you. Now you belong to Duryodhana. I have come by Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s command to take you to serve in his household as maid servant, which will hereafter be your office.&amp;rdquo; Draupadi, the spouse of the emperor who had performed Rajasuya, was dumbfounded, at this strange message.</description>

      <description>WHEN the Pandavas set out for the forest, there arose a great clamor of lamentation from people who thronged the streets and climbed the roofs and towers and trees to see them go. The princes, who, of yore, rode in jewelled chariots or on lordly elephants to strains of auspicious music, now walked away from their birthright on weary feet, accompanied by weeping crowds. On all sides cries arose of: &amp;ldquo;Fie and Alas!</description>

      <description>As SOON as the news of the slaying of Sisupala by Krishna reached his friend Salva, he became very angry and besieged Dwaraka with a mighty force. Krishna having not yet returned to Dwaraka, old Ugrasena was in charge of the defence of the city. The sieges described in the Mahabharata seem very much like those in wars of the present day. Dwaraka was a strongly garrisoned fortress built on an island and well provided with means of defence.</description>

      <description>IN the beginning of their stay in the forest, Bhima and Draupadi used, on occasions, to argue with Yudhishthira. They would plead that only righteous anger befitted a kshatriya and thatpatience and forbearance under slights and insults were not worthy of him. They would quote weighty authorities and argue vehemently in support of their contention. Yudhishthira would firmly reply that they should abide by the promise they had made and that forbearance was the highest virtue of all.</description>

      <description>BALARAMA and Krishna came with their retinue to the abode of the Pandavas in the forest. Deeply distressed by what he saw, Balarama said to Krishna: &amp;ldquo;O Krishna, it would seem that virtue and wickedness bear contrary fruit in this life. For see, the wicked Duryodhana is ruling his kingdom clad in silk and gold, while the virtuous Yudhishthira lives in the forest wearing the bark of trees. Seeing such unmerited prosperity and undeserved privation, men have lost their faith in God.</description>

      <description>THE brahmanas, who had been with Yudhishthira in Indraprastha, had followed him to the forest. It was difficult to maintain such a large establishment. Some time after Arjuna had gone on his quest of Pasupata, a brahmana sage named Lomasa came to the abode of the Pandavas. He advised Yudhishthira to minimize his retinue before going on pilgrimage as it would be difficult to move freely from place to place with a large following.</description>

      <description>IT is an error to think that it is easy for a person to lead a life of chastity if he is brought up in complete ignorance of sensual pleasures. Virtue guarded only by ignorance is very insecure as illustrated by the following story. It is told in the Ramayana also, but not in the same detail. Vibhandaka who was resplendent like Brahma, the Creator, lived with his son Rishyasringa in a forest.</description>

      <description>IN the course of their wanderings, the Pandavas reached the hermitage of Raibhya on the banks of the Ganga. Lomasa told them the story of the place: &amp;ldquo;This is the ghat where Bharata, the son of Dasaratha, bathed. These waters cleansed Indra of the sin of killing Vritra unfairly. Here also Sanatkumara became one with God. Aditi, the mother of the gods, offered oblations on this mountain and prayed to be blessed with a son.</description>

      <description>YAVAKRIDA studied the Vedas and became learned. He grew vain with the thought that he had acquired the knowledge of the Vedas through the boon of Indra and not through human tutelage. Bharadwaja did not like this and feared that his son might ruin himself by slighting Raibhya. He thought it necessary to warm him. &amp;ldquo;The gods,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;grant boons to foolish people who persistently practise penances, as intoxicants are sold to fools for money.</description>

      <description>KING Brihadyumna, a disciple of the sage Raibhya, performed a great sacrifice at which he requested his teacher to let his two sons Paravasu and Arvavasu officiate. With the permission of their father, both of them went joyfully to the capital of the king. While arrangements were being made for the sacrifice, Paravasu desired one day to go and see his wife and, walking alone all night, he reached his hermitage before dawn.</description>

      <description>WHILE the Pandavas were wandering among holy places in the forest, they came one day to the hermitage of the personages immortalized in theUpanishads. Lomasa told Yudhishthira the story of that place. Udalaka, a great sage and teacher of Vedanta, had a disciple named Kagola, who was virtuous and devoted but had no great learning. So, the other disciples used to laugh and mock at him. Uddalaka, however, attached no great weight to his disciple&amp;rsquo;s lack of erudition but really appreciated his virtues, devotion and good conduct and gave his daughter Sujata in marriage to him.</description>

      <description>DRAUPADI used to complain frequently: &amp;ldquo;This Kamyaka forest is not beautiful without Arjuna. I find no joy in life in the absence of Arjuna.&amp;rdquo; The other Pandavas shared Draupadi&amp;rsquo;s wretchedness at separation from Arjuna, who had gone to the Himalayas in quest of divine weapons. Bhimasena told Draupadi: &amp;ldquo;Blessed lady, I myself feel the same about Arjuna and what you say makes me thrill with love and sympathy. Bereft of Arjuna, this beautiful forest seems desolate.</description>

      <description>ONCE the sage Markandeya came to see the Pandavas. Yudhishthira happened to talk of the virtues of the fair sex and said: &amp;ldquo;What greater wonder is there in this world than the patience and the chastity of woman? She gives birth to a child after cherishing it in her womb as dearer than life itself. She brings it into the world inpain and anxiety and thence forward her one thought is for its health and happiness.</description>

      <description>MANY brahmanas visited the Pandavas during their exile. And one such, returning to Hastinapura, went to see Dhritarashtra, who received him with due honor. The brahmana told him how the Pandavas, born princes, were, by unkind destiny, at the mercy of the wind and the sun and suffered great privations. Dhritarashtra was probably sorry to hear this. But what troubled him most were the consequences to his own sons. CouldYudhishthira continue to hold the justly wrathful Bhima in check?</description>

      <description>THE Kauravas reached Dwaitavana with a great army and many followers. Duryodhana and Karna went with unconcealed joy at the very thought of being able to gloat on the sad plight of the Pandavas. They themselves camped in luxurious rest houses in a place four miles off the abode of the Pandavas. They inspected the herds of cows and took stock of them. After counting the cows, bulls and calves, they enjoyed the dance, the hunt, the sylvan sports and other entertainment’s arranged for them.</description>

      <description>WHILE the Pandavas were dwelling in the forest, Duryodhana celebrated a great sacrifice with much pomp and splendor. He wanted to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice, but the brahmanas told him that he could not do that while Yudhishthira and Dhritarashtra were alive and advised him to perform the sacrifice known as the Vaishnava instead. He accepted this advice and celebrated the Vaishnava with great splendor. But when the ceremony was over, the citizens began to talk among themselves that Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice had not come up to even a sixteenth part of Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s Rajasuya in magnificence.</description>

      <description>THE stipulated period of twelve years was drawing to a close. One day, a deer was rubbing itself against a poor brahmana&amp;rsquo;s fire-kindling mortar and as it turned to go, the mortar got entangled in its horns and the affrighted animal fled wildly with it into the forest. In those days matches were unknown and fire was kindled with pieces of wood by mechanical friction. &amp;ldquo;Alas! The deer is running away with my fire-kindler.</description>

Still we have passed these years cheerfully with joy in the forest. The thirteenth year of exile has come, and with it the time for us to part from you. For we have to spend the next twelve months undiscovered by the spies of Duryodhana. God knows when the day will dawn which will see us together again, without fear or concealment.</description>

      <description>YUDHISHTHIRA put on the garb of a sanyasin. Arjuna transformed himself into a eunuch. Others also disguised themselves. But no disguise could take away their natural charm, grace and nobility of appearance. When they went to King Virata seeking service, they seemed to him born to command and rule rather than to serve. He hesitated, at first, to engage them in service but yielding to their urgent solicitations, he finally appointed them to the places they sought of him.</description>

She is a great danger to the people of the city and the members of the royal household, for the Gandharvas may stop at nothing in their jealous anger.

And presently the Kaurava army was sighted, at first a gleaming, line, enveloped in a cloud of dust that seemed to go up to the skies.</description>

The hearts of the Kauravas quaked when they heard the twang of the Gandiva bow. &amp;ldquo;Our army must be arrayed well and with care. Arjuna, has come,&amp;rdquo; said Drona anxiously. Duryodhana did not at all like the honor Drona did Arjuna by this anxiety. He said to Karna: &amp;ldquo;The Pandavas&amp;rsquo; pledge was that they would spend twelve years in the forest and the following year undiscovered.</description>

When he reached his palace, he saw that Uttara was not there and the womenfolk told him with much elation that Uttara had set out to conquer the Kauravas. They had not a doubt that their hand some prince could conquer the whole world. But the king&amp;rsquo;s heart sank within him at the news, for he knew the impossible task which the delicately nurtured prince had taken on himself with no better following than a eunuch.</description>

      <description>THE thirteenth year during which the Pandavas had to remain undiscovered came to an end. No longer obliged to be in disguise, they left Virata&amp;rsquo;s capital as Pandavas and settled openly in Upaplavya, another place in Matsya territory. From there, they sent emissaries to summon their friends and relatives. From Dwaraka came Balarama and Krishna with Arjuna’s wife Subhadra, and her son, Abhimanyu and accompanied by many Yadava warriors. Loud and long was the blare of trumpet-conchs as the Matsya prince and the Pandavas went forth to receive Janardana.</description>

      <description>HAVING sent Drupada&amp;rsquo;s brahmana to Hastinapura on the peace mission, the Pandavas sent word, at the same time, to the princes likely to favor their cause to collect their forces and hold themselves in readiness for war. To Dwaraka, Arjuna went himself. Having understood through his spies the turn events were taking, Duryodhana too did not remain idle. Learning that Vasudeva (Krishna) was back in his home city, he sped towards Dwaraka in his chariot, as fast as his swiftest horses could take him.</description>

      <description>SALYA, the ruler of Madradesa, was the brother of Madri, the mother of Nakula and Sahadeva. He heard that the Pandavas were camping in the city of Upaplavya and making preparations for war. He collected a very big army and set off towards that city to join the Pandavas. Salya&amp;rsquo;s army was so large that where it halted for rest, the encampment extended over a length of nearly fifteen miles. News of Salya and his marching forces reached Duryodhana.</description>

      <description>INDRA, the Lord of the three regions, was once so drunk with pride that he quite forgot the courteous manners and forms that the gods had hitherto observed. When Brihaspati, preceptor of the gods, foremost in all branches of learning, and venerated alike by the gods and the asuras, came to his court, Indra did not rise from his seat to receive the acharya or ask him to be seated and failed to do the customary honors.</description>

      <description>THE sin of the unrighteous slaughter of Vritra pulled Indra down from his high estate and made him a fugitive. Nahusha became the king of the gods in his stead. Nahusha started well, assisted by the merit and the fame earned by him while he was a king on earth. Thereafter, he fell on evil days.The assumption of the kingship of the gods filled him with arrogance, He lost his humility and became filled with lawless desires.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas were camping at Upaplavya in Virata&amp;rsquo;s territory. From there, they sent emissaries to all friendly rulers. Contingents arrived from all parts of the country and soon, the Pandavas had a mighty force of seven divisions. The Kauravas did likewise and collected an army of eleven divisions. Then, as now, a division was made up of all arms grouped together in accordance with established military practice. In those days, a division consisted of 21,870 chariots, an equal number of elephants, thrice as many horses and five times as many foot soldiers, and they were provided with weapons of all kinds and other war equipment.</description>

      <description>AFTER he had despatched Sanjaya to the Pandavas, Dhritarashtra, filled with anxiety, could not get a wink of sleep that night. He sent for Vidura and spent the whole night talking to him. &amp;ldquo;To give the Pandavas their share of the kingdom is the safest plan,&amp;rdquo; said Vidura. &amp;ldquo;Only this can bring good to both sides. Treat the Pandavas and your own sons with equal affection. In this case, the right course is also the wise one.</description>

      <description>SATYAKI accompanied Govinda (Krishna) to Hastinapura. Before setting out on his journey, Krishna had a lone discussion with the Pandavas. Even the mighty Bhima, rather surprisingly, supported a peaceful settlement. &amp;ldquo;Let not the race be destroyed. Peace is very much to be preferred,&amp;rdquo; said he. The poet Vyasa makes Bhima speak thus in order to show that truly great warriors desire peace, and that to seek peace is not a sign of fear.</description>

      <description>ANY ray of hope there might have been of a peaceful settlement when Krishna went to Hastinapura was extinguished when he returned and narrated what happened. Kunti was overwhelmed with grief when she learnt that it was to be war to the death. &amp;ldquo;How can I&amp;rdquo; reflected Kunti, &amp;ldquo;give my thoughts tongue and say to my sons, &amp;lsquo;Bear the insults. Let us not ask for any territory and let us avoid war&amp;rsquo;?</description>

      <description>GOVINDA reached Upaplavya and told the Pandavas what had happened in Hastinapura. &amp;ldquo;I spoke urging what was right and what was also good for them. But, it was all in vain. There is now no way out except the fourth, that is, the last alternative of war. The foolish Duryodhana would not listen to the advice tendered to him by the elders in the assembly. We must now prepare for war without delay.</description>

      <description>BALARAMA, the illustrious brother of Krishna, visited the Pandavas, in their encampment. As Halayudha (plough bearer), clad in blue silk, entered majestically like a lion. Yudhishthira, Krishna and others gave the broad- shouldered warrior a glad welcome. Bowing to Drupada and Virata, the visitor seated himself beside Dharmaputra. &amp;ldquo;I have come to Kurukshetra,&amp;rdquo; said he, &amp;ldquo;learning that the descendants of Bharata have let themselves be overwhelmed by greed, anger and hatred and that the peace talks have broken down and that war has been declared.</description>

      <description>BHISHMAKA, the king of Vidarbha, had five sons and an only daughter, Rukmini, a princess of matchless beauty, charm and strength of character. Having heard of Krishna and his renown, she wished to be united to him in wedlock and the desire daily grew in intensity. Her relatives approved the idea, all except her eldest brother Rukma, the heir apparent, between whom and Krishna there was no love lost. Rukma pressed his father not to give Rukmini in marriage to the ruler of Dwaraka but to marry her instead to Sisupala, the king of Chedi.</description>

      <description>IT was the day before the commencement of the great battle. The grandsire, now the Kaurava Generalissimo, was with Duryodhana seeking to inspire him with his own heroic spirit and cheerfulness. Bhishma spoke of the strength, skill and prowess of the warriors ranged on the Kauravas&amp;rsquo; side. Duryodhana was cheered up. Presently, Karna became the subject of their talk. &amp;ldquo;Karna has earned your affection,&amp;rdquo; said Bhishma, &amp;ldquo;but I do not think much of him.</description>

The code of conduct in war and methods of warfare vary from time to time. It is only if what was in vogue at the time of the Mahabharata war is kept in mind that we can understand the epic. Otherwise, the story would be puzzling in places.</description>

      <description>EVERYTHING was ready for the battle to begin. At this tense moment, both armies saw with amazement Yudhishthira, the steadfast and brave son of Pandu, suddenly doff his armor and put away his weapons. Descending from his chariot, he proceeded on foot towards the commander of the Kaurava forces. &amp;ldquo;What is this that Yudhishthira is doing?&amp;rdquo; asked everyone and was puzzled by this sudden and silent proceeding on the part of the Pandava.</description>

      <description>THE Pandava army, having fared badly on the first day of the battle, Dhrishtadyumna, the Generalissimo, devised measures to avoid a repetition of it. On the second day, the army was most carefully arrayed and everything was done to instil confidence. Duryodhana, filled with conceit on account of the success on the first day, stood in the center of his army and addressed his warriors. &amp;ldquo;Heroes in armor&amp;rdquo;, he said in a loud voice, &amp;ldquo;our victory is assured.</description>

      <description>ON the morning of the third day Bhishma arrayed his army in eagle formation and himself led it while Duryodhana and his forces protected the rear. So great was the care taken over every detail that the Kauravas were certain that there could be no mishap for them that day. The Pandavas too arrayed their forces with skill. Dhananjaya and Dhrishtadyumna decided in favor of a crescent formation of their army so as more effectually to cope with the eagle formation of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s forces.</description>

      <description>THE battle was very much the same every day and the narrative is one of monotonous fighting and killing. Still, the great battle is the central event in the Mahabharata and, if we skip over it, we cannot fully understand the epic heroes of that crowded stage. At break of day, Bhishma arrayed the Kaurava forces again. Surrounded by Drona, Duryodhana and others, the grandsire looked verily like great Indra, holding his thunder bolt, surrounded by the devas.</description>

      <description>ACCORDING to Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s order Dhrishtadyumna arrayed the Pandava army in makara (fish) formation for the sixth day&amp;rsquo;s battle. The Kaurava army was arrayed in krauncha (heron) formation. We know, how, similarly, names were given to physical exercise, asanas, or postures. Vyuha was the general name for battle array. Which Vyuha was best for any particular occasion, depended on the requirements of the offensive and defensive plans of the day. What the strength and composition of the forces arrayed should be and what positions they should take up were decided upon, according to the situation as it developed from time to time.</description>

Our formations are broken and our warriors are being slain in large numbers. You are looking on doing nothing.&amp;rdquo; The grandsire soothed Duryodhana with comforting words: &amp;ldquo;Why do you let yourself be disheartened? Here are all of us, Drona, Salya, Kritavarma, Aswatthama, Vikarna, Bhagadatta, Sakuni, the two brothers of Avanti, the Trigarta chief, the king of Magadha, and Kripacharya.</description>

      <description>WHEN the eighth day dawned, Bhishma arrayed his army in tortoise formation. Yudhishthira said to Dhrishtadyumna: &amp;ldquo;See there, the enemy is in kurma vyuha (tortoise formation). You have to answer at once with a formation that can break it.&amp;rdquo; Dhrishtadyumna immediately proceeded to his task. The Pandava forces were arrayed in a three-pronged formation. Bhima was at the head of one prong, Satyaki of another, and Yudhishthira at the crest of the middle division.</description>

      <description>ON the morning of the ninth day, before the battle began, Duryodhana was closeted with the grandsire. He gave vent to his bitter feelings of disappointment over the way the battle was going. He uttered words that were like the sharp spears and pained the grandsire greatly but the latter was patient and said sadly: &amp;ldquo;Like ghee on the sacrificial fire I am pouring my life out for you.

When Sikhandin&amp;rsquo;s darts pierced his breast, sparks flew from the grandsire&amp;rsquo;s eyes. For a moment the old warrior&amp;rsquo;s anger rose like flaming fire and his eyes glared as if to consume Sikhandin. But, at once, the grandsire restrained himself. He decided not to be provoked into fighting Sikhandin, who was born a woman and to strike whom it seemed unworthy of a warrior.</description>

      <description>WHEN he learnt that Bhishma lay wounded and dying, Karna hurried to the place and fell at his feet and said:&amp;ldquo;Eldest of the race. Radha&amp;rsquo;s son, who, through no fault of his, incurred your great displeasure, humbly prostrates himself before you.&amp;rdquo; When after humble salutation Karna stood up, the grandsire, greatly moved, tenderly placed his hand on Karna&amp;rsquo;s head and blessed him. &amp;ldquo;You are not Radha&amp;rsquo;s son, young man,&amp;rdquo; he said in loving tones: &amp;ldquo;You are Kuntidevi&amp;rsquo;s own first born.</description>

      <description>DURYODHANA and Karna held counsel as to who should be put in supreme command of the forces. &amp;ldquo;Well, everyone of these princely warriors fighting on your side is great enough to be put in charge of our forces as supreme commander,&amp;rdquo; said Karna. &amp;ldquo;All these kings are of equal prowess, strength, energy, skill, courage, valor, ancestry and wisdom. They cannot all be put in joint command and, if any of them be chosen, each of the others would feel hurt and may not put forth his whole strength in the cause.</description>

      <description>AS SOON AS Drona assumed command of the Kaurava forces Duryodhana, Karna and Duhsasana sat in council and decided on a plan. And Duryodhana went to Dronacharya to put it in operation. &amp;ldquo;Acharya, we desire that you should capture Yudhishthira alive and give him over to us. We desire nothing more, not even a total victory. If you achieve this for us, we shall all be exceedingly satisfied with your conduct of the war.</description>

      <description>THE attempt to capture Yudhishthira alive failed. Drona was speaking to Duryodhana about this. &amp;ldquo;It is clear we cannot succeed in our efforts to seize Yudhishthira so long as Dhananjaya is nearby. It is no want of interest on my part. If by some stratagem we could draw Arjuna away to some other part of the field, I could pierce the Pandava formations and capture Yudhishthira. I promise to seize him and deliver him to you provided he does not flee from the battle, renouncing honor.</description>

      <description>DRONA made many attempts to take Yudhishthira prisoner, but failed. Duryodhana led a large elephant division against Bhima. Bhima defended himself from his chariot with well-aimed arrows. He sent crescent-headed shafts and tore down Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s flag and cut down his bow even as he held it in his hand. Seeing the king harassed in this manner, the Mlechchha king Anga marched against Bhimasena seated on a huge elephant. But Bhima sent shafts that laid the elephant low and killed the Mlechchha king, which resulted in scattering that section of the Kaurava forces in fear and confusion.</description>

      <description>EARLY next morning, Duryodhana went to Dronacharya in a state of bitterness and anger. After the customary salutation, he addressed him thus in the presence of a large number of generals: &amp;ldquo;Esteemed brahmana, Yudhishthira was quite within your reach yesterday and, if you had really wished to take him no one could have prevented you. Yet, you did not take him, and to me the events of yesterday are inexplicable. I cannot understand what makes it hard for you to carry out your promise to me.</description>

      <description>THE Pandavas, proceeding according to plan, had closely followed Abhimanyu when he broke into the Kaurava formation. But Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s son-in-law Jayadratha, the gallant king of the Sindhus, swooped down upon the Pandavas with all his forces and enabled the breach in the formation to be effectively and solidly closed up, so that the Pandavas found it impossible to force their way in. Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s bow. But in an instant, the Saindhava took up another bow and sent unerring shafts at Dharmaputra.</description>

      <description>YUDHISHTHIRA was plunged in sorrow. &amp;ldquo;He has gone to the sleep that knows no waking, he who in battle overcame Drona, Aswatthama and Duryodhana and who was like a destroying fire to enemy forces. O warrior that made Duhsasana flee in fear, are you dead? What then is there for me to fight for or win? Why do we want kingdom now? What words of comfort can I offer to Arjuna?</description>

      <description>NEWS of Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s oath reached the enemy. The spies informed Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s friends that Arjuna, having learnt that Jayadratha was the cause of Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s death, had vowed to kill the Sindhu king before sunset next day. Vriddhakshatra, the illustrious king of the Sindhus, was blessed with a son, who was named Jayadratha. At the time of the birth of the prince, a voice was heard to say: &amp;ldquo;This prince will attain great glory and he will attain the happy regions above, slain in battle.</description>

      <description>WHEN Dhritarashtra heard Sanjaya relate the success of Arjuna, he exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Oh Sanjaya! When Janardana came to Hastinapura seeking a settlement, I told Duryodhana that it was a great opportunity and he must not lose it. I told him to make peace with his cousins. &amp;lsquo;Kesava has come to do us a good turn. Do not disregard his advice,&amp;rsquo; I said. But Duryodhana heeded not. What Karna and Duhsasana said seemed to him better advice than mine.</description>

      <description>WHEN the Pandavas saw Duryodhana proceeding in the direction of Arjuna, they attacked the Kaurava army in force so as to hold Drona and prevent him from going to Jayadratha&amp;rsquo;s rescue. So, Dhrishtadyumna led his forces repeatedly against Drona. As a result of all this, the Kaurava army had to fight on three fronts, and was greatly weakened. Driving his chariot right against Drona&amp;rsquo;s, Dhrishtadyumna attacked him violently. Drona&amp;rsquo;s chestnut horses and the Panchala&amp;rsquo;s dove-colored ones were entangled with one another and presented a picturesque sight like the clouds at sunset.</description>

Satyaki, that bravest and most loyal of friends, has not come back with any tidings. My anxiety is increasing every moment,&amp;rdquo; said Yudhishthira to Bhima in great perplexity of mind. &amp;ldquo;I have never seen you so agitated,&amp;rdquo; replied Bhimasena. &amp;ldquo;Do, not let your fortitude grow less.</description>

      <description>ARJUNA had left Yudhishthira behind to repel Drona&amp;rsquo;s attacks and had gone to make good his word that before sunset Jayadratha would lie dead on the field of battle. Jayadratha had been the main cause of Abhimanyu&amp;rsquo;s death. He it was who had effectively prevented the relief of Abhimanyu by the Pandavas, and thereby caused Abhimanyu to be isolated, overpowered and slain. We have seen how Yudhishthira in his anxiety sent first Satyaki and then Bhima to join Arjuna in his battle against Jayadratha.</description>

With Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s death, the destruction of the Pandavas is certain and this kingdom will be ours in unquestioned and absolute sovereignty. Dhananjaya swore this impossible oath in a moment of thoughtlessness, because the gods had willed it that he should be thus destroyed by his own hand.</description>

      <description>ALL those who have heard the story of the Mahabharata know about Ghatotkacha, Bhimasena&amp;rsquo;s famous son by his asura wife. There are two young men among the Mahabharata figures who embody all the qualities of heroism, fortitude, strength, courage, and amiability. They are Arjuna&amp;rsquo;s son, Abhimanyu, and Bhima&amp;rsquo;s son, Ghatotkacha. Both of them gave up their lives on the Kurukshetra battlefield. Towards the latter part of the Mahabharata fight, the hatred roused onboth sides did not find satisfaction in battle conducted during the daytime and close at nightfall.</description>

      <description>WHEN Drona died, the princes of the Kaurava army installed Karna as Generalissimo. Karna stood up in his gorgeous war chariot driven by Salya. The dauntless confidence of his bearing and his great renown as a warrior heartened the Kauravas. The battle again began. Readers of the stars were consulted and the Pandavas chose the propitious hour for grim battle. Arjuna led the attack on Karna, supported by Bhimasena immediately behind his chariot.</description>

Kripacharya was deeply moved by Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s anguish of heart and said: &amp;ldquo;Moved by ambition and greed we placed too great a burden on friends. They have uncomplainingly borne it and laid down their lives on the battlefield and attained the happy regions above. There is but one course left to you to make peace with the Pandavas.

      <description>WHEN the war was nearing its end, Balarama arrived at Kurukshetra after completing his tour of holy places. He came just when Bhima and Duryodhana were engaged in their last mortal combat. He saw Bhima aiming the deadly blow which broke Duryodhana&amp;rsquo;s thighs, and his anger flamed up at this great breach of the rules of single combat. &amp;ldquo;Fie upon you all! Would any kshatriya hit below the navel? This Bhima has offended the law most disgracefully,&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed and impatiently going up to his brother Krishna, shouted: &amp;ldquo;You can look on and tolerate all this.</description>

The deception, practised by the Pandavas in order to bring about his father&amp;rsquo;s end, had been rankling in his mind. Now, when he learnt how Duryodhana had been stricken down mortally against all rules of chivalry, he went to the spot where Duryodhana was lying and there took an oath that he would that night send the Pandavas to the abode of Yama.</description>

The entire army of theirs has been destroyed. We made a night attack on them when they were asleep. There are only seven survivors now on the Pandava side. On our side, Kripacharya, Kritavarma and I remain.&amp;rdquo; Thus said Aswatthama to the dying Duryodhana who, on hearing this, slowly opened his eyes and, with struggling breath, gasped out these words: &amp;ldquo;Aswatthama, you have indeed done for me what neither the great Bhishma nor the valiant Karna could achieve!</description>

But, of what avail was weeping? &amp;ldquo;O king, words of consolation addressed to a bereaved person do not remove his grief.</description>

      <description>YUDHISHTHIRA&amp;rsquo;S pain of mind increased everyday as he thought of all the kinsmen that had been killed. He was stricken with intense remorse and decided he must give up the world go to the forest and do penance to expiate his sin. &amp;ldquo;I see no joy or good,&amp;rdquo; he said to his brothers, in taking up the office of king or in worldly enjoyment. Do rule the land yourselves leaving me free to go to the forest.</description>

      <description>AFTER the libation ceremony for Bhishma was over, Vyasa narrated to grief-stricken Yudhishthira an episode in Brihaspati&amp;rsquo;s life. The wisest of men are sometimes affected by envy and suffer thereby. Brihaspati, teacher to the gods themselves, was master of all knowledge. He was learned in all the Vedas and all the sciences, yet he was once the victim of this debasing emotion and suffered disgrace. Brihaspati had a younger brother, Samvarta, who was also a person of great learning and a very good man.</description>

      <description>WHEN the battle was over, Krishna bade farewell to the Pandavas and went to Dwaraka. While on his way, he met his old brahmana friend Utanga. Krishna stopped and descending from his chariot saluted the brahmana. Utanga returned the greeting and proceeded to make the usual inquiries about the health and welfare of relatives. &amp;ldquo;Madhava, do your cousins the Pandavas and the Kauravas love one another as brothers should? Are they well and flourishing?</description>

      <description>MAN pursues madly the object of his desire until it is got. When it is in his possession, he is soon satisfied, but he becomes the slave of ever-fresh longings and fresh griefs and finds no peace. Although to fight and to kill his enemies is a Kshatriyas dharma, what joy can one gets out of power and position and wealth acquired by slaughter and grief inflicted on brothers and near relations?</description>

      <description>FIFTEEN years passed under king Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s reign, when old Dhritarashtra found himself utterly unable any longer to bear the burden of grief. Hurt by Bhima&amp;rsquo;s occasional reproaches, he found no heart to accept the courtesies and comforts provided under king Yudhishthira&amp;rsquo;s orders. Unknown to the Pandavas, he secretly fasted and underwent hard penances. Gandhari too observed manifests and inflicted privation on her. And one day Dhritarashtra sent for Dharmaputra and spoke to him thus: &amp;ldquo;Son, blessings on you.</description>

      <description>WHEN Yudhishthira at last gave his consent for Dhritarashtra&amp;rsquo;s retirement to the forest, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari went back to their residence and broke their fast. Kunti sat with Gandhari and they ate together. Dhritarashtra asked Yudhishthira to sit by him and gave him his last blessings. Then the old man stepped out and, with his hand resting on Gandhari&amp;rsquo;s shoulder, slowly walked out of the city on his journey to the forest.</description>

      <description>KRISHNA ruled at Dwaraka for thirty-six years after the Kurukshetra battle was over. The Vrishnis, the Bhopas and other branches of the Yadavas belonging to Krishna&amp;rsquo;s tribe spent their days in unrestrained self-indulgence and luxury. They lost all sense of discipline and humility. Once, some rishis came to Dwaraka. The arrogant and irreverent Yadavas mocked these rishis with a practical joke. They dressed up one of their young men like a woman and, presenting him to the revered guests, said: &amp;ldquo;O ye learned men, tell us whether this lady will have a boy or a girl.</description>

      <description>To Hastinapura came the sad tidings of the death of Vasudeva and the destruction of the Yadavas. When the Pandavas received the news, they lost all remaining attachment to life on earth.
They crowned Parikshit, son of Abhimanyu, as emperor and the five brothers left the city with Draupadi. They went out on a pilgrimage, visiting holy places and finally reached the Himalayas. A dog joined them somewhere and kept them company all along.</description>
