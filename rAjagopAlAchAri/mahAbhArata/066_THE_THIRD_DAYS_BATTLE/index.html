  <p>ON the morning of the third day Bhishma
arrayed his army in eagle formation and
himself led it while Duryodhana and his
forces protected the rear. So great was the
care taken over every detail that the
Kauravas were certain that there could be
no mishap for them that day.
The Pandavas too arrayed their forces
with
skill.
Dhananjaya
and
Dhrishtadyumna decided in favor of a
crescent formation of their army so as
more effectually to cope with the eagle
formation of the enemy&rsquo;s forces.
On the right horn of the crescent stood
Bhima and on the left Arjuna, leading the
respective divisions. The battle began. All
arms were at once engaged and blood
flowed in torrents and the dust that was
raised by chariots, horses and elephants
rose to hide the sun.
Dhananjaya&rsquo;s attack was powerful but the
enemy stood firm. A counter-attack was
made by the Kauravas concentrating on
Arjuna&rsquo;s position. Javelins and spears and
other missiles flew in the air shining like
forked lightning in a thunderstorm.
Like a great cloud of locusts the shafts
covered Arjuna&rsquo;s chariot. But with
amazing skill he raised a moving
fortification around his chariot with
arrows discharged in an unending stream
from his famous bow.
At another point Sakuni led a large force
against Satyaki and Abhimanyu. Satyaki&rsquo;s
chariot was broken to pieces and he had to
scramble up Abhimanyu&rsquo;s chariot and
thereafter both fought from the same
chariot.
They were able to destroy Sakuni&rsquo;s forces.
Drona and Bhishma jointly attacked
Dharmaputra&rsquo;s division and Nakula and
Sahadeva joined their brother in opposing
Drona&rsquo;s offensive.
Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked
Duryodhana&rsquo;s division and in that day&rsquo;s
battle the son appeared to excel his great
father in valor.
Bhima&rsquo;s shafts hit Duryodhana and he lay
in swoon in his chariot. His charioteer
quickly drove the chariot away from the
scene. He feared that the Kaurava forces
would be completely demoralised if they
saw that the prince had been disabled.
But even this movement created great
confusion. Bhimasena took full advantage
of the position and worked havoc among
the fleeing Kaurava forces.
Drona and Bhishma who saw the
discomfiture and confusion of the
Kaurava army came up quickly and
restored confidence. The scattered forces
were brought together and Duryodhana
was again seen leading them.
&ldquo;How can you stand thus,&rdquo; said
Duryodhana to the grandsire, &ldquo;looking on
when our forces are scattered and put to
disgraceful flight? I fear you are too kind
to the Pandavas. Why did you not tell me
frankly
&lsquo;I
love
the
Pandavas;
Dhrishtadyumna and Satyaki are my
friends and I cannot attack or slay them.&rsquo;
You should have stated the position
explicitly to me. Surely these men are not
equal to you. And if you were so minded,
you could deal with them easily. Even
now, it would be best if you and Drona
told me frankly your mind in the matter.&rdquo;
The chagrin of defeat, and the knowledge
that the grandsire disapproved of his ways
made Duryodhana speak thus bitterly. But
Bhishma merely smiled and said: &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
I quite frank in my advice to you? That
advice you rejected when you decided on
war. I tried to prevent the war but, now
that it has come, I am fulfilling my duties
by you with all my might. I am an old
man and what I am doing is quite my
utmost.&ldquo;Saying thus, the grandsire resumed his
operations. The turn of events in the
forenoon had been so much in their favor
that the delighted Pandavas were now
somewhat careless.
They did not expect Bhishma to rally his
forces and attack them again. But stung by
Duryodhana&rsquo;s reproaches, the grandsire
raged about the field like a destroying fire.
He rallied his men and delivered the most
severe attack yet made on the Pandava
army. The latter thought that the grandsire
had multiplied himself into a number of
Bhishmas fighting at several points. So
swift were his movements that afternoon.
Those who opposed him were struck
down and perished like months in the fire.
The Pandava army was thoroughly broken
and began to scatter. Vasudeva, Partha
and Sikhandin tried hard to restore order
and confidence, but were unsuccessful.
&ldquo;Dhanjaya,&rdquo; said Krishna, &ldquo;now has the
critical time come. Be true to your
decision not to flinch from your duty to
kill in battle Bhishma, Drona and all the
other friends and relatives and respected
elders. You have pledged yourself to it
and you have now to carry it out.
Otherwise our army is lost beyond
redemption. You must now attack the
grandsire.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Drive on,&rdquo; said Arjuna.
As Dhananjaya&rsquo;s chariot sped on towards
Bhishma, it met a hot reception from the
grandsire, who covered it with his arrows.
But, Arjuna bent his bow and discharged
three shafts that broke the grandsire&rsquo;s bow.
Bhishma picked up another bow but it too
met the same fate. The grandsire&rsquo;s heart
was gladdened when he saw Arjuna&rsquo;s skill
in archery.
&ldquo;Hail, brave warrior!&rdquo; applauded the
grandsire, even as, taking up another bow;
he poured shafts on Arjuna&rsquo;s chariot with
unerring aim.
Krishna was not happy at the way Arjuna
met the attack. The grandsire&rsquo;s bow was
working fiercely. But Arjuna&rsquo;s hands did
not do their best, for his heart was not in
it.
He had too much regard for his great
grandsire. Krishna thought that, if Arjuna
went on like this, the army, which had
been so badly demoralized already, would
be utterly destroyed and all would be lost.
Krishna managed the chariot skilfully, but
in spite of it, both he and Arjuna were hit
many times by Bhishma&rsquo;s arrows.
Janardana&rsquo;s (Krishna) anger rose. &ldquo;I can
stand this no longer, Arjuna. I shall kill
Bhishma myself if you will not do it!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, and dropping the reins, he took
up his discus and jumped down from the
chariot and dashed forward towards
Bhishma.
Bhishma was far from being perturbed at
this. On the contrary, his face expanded
with ecstatic joy. &ldquo;Come, come, Oh Lotus-
eyed One!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I bow to you, Oh Madhava. Lord of the
World, have you indeed come down from
the chariot for my sake? I offer you my
life. If I be slain by you, I shall be
glorified in the three worlds. Give me that
boon. May your hands take this life away
and save me for eternity.&rdquo;
Arjuna was distressed to see this. He
jumped down and ran after Krishna.
Overtaking him with great difficulty, he
entreated Krishna to turn back.
&ldquo;Do not lose your patience with me.
Desist and I promise not to flinch,&rdquo; he
said, and persuaded Krishna to return. The
chariot reins were again in Krishna&rsquo;s
hands. Arjuna attacked the Kaurava forces
furiously and thousands were slain by
him.
The Kauravas suffered a severe defeat on
the evening of the third day. As they
returned to their camps in torchlight, they
said to one another: &ldquo;Who can equalArjuna? There is nothing strange in his
being victorious.&rdquo; So marvelous was
Arjuna&rsquo;s prowess that day.</p>
