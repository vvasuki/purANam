  <p>WHEN
Aswatthama
heard
how
Duryodhana lay mortally injured, and
learnt the details of the combat, his
righteous anger swelled like the sea. The
deception, practised by the Pandavas in
order to bring about his father&rsquo;s end, had
been rankling in his mind.
Now, when he learnt how Duryodhana
had been stricken down mortally against
all rules of chivalry, he went to the spot
where Duryodhana was lying and there
took an oath that he would that night send
the Pandavas to the abode of Yama.
Duryodhana, who was in the last physical
agony of departing life, was transported
with joy when he heard Aswatthama take
this oath. He immediately ordered those
who stood nearby to install Aswatthama
as Supreme Commander of the Army with
due ceremony and, when that was over,
said to Him: &ldquo;All my hopes are in you.&rdquo;
It was sunset and the forest was in utter
darkness when under a big banian tree
Kripacharya, Kritavarma and Aswatthama
halted for rest. They were so greatly
fatigued that Kripacharya and Kritavarma
fell fast asleep as soon as they lay down.
But Aswatthama did not get sleep, for
sorrow, indignation and hatred burnt
within him. He was listening to the noises
that the nocturnal birds and prowling
beasts began to make as the night
advanced. He was turning over in his
mind how to execute his promise to
Duryodhana.
On the branches of the banian tree, under
which the three warriors were resting,
hundreds of crows roosted. They were all
quiet and asleep until a big owl came and
began to attack the birds one after another
and kill them. When Aswatthama saw the
nocturnal bird of prey tear the helpless
crows, he got an idea. The crows that
could not see at night flew round and
round helplessly and fell victims to the
owl that attacked them violently.
&ldquo;These wicked Pandavas and the Panchala
that killed my father and all their
supporters can easily be killed by us, if we
surprise them when they are sleeping in
their tents at night even as this owl is
attacking these blind crows. Thus can I
avenge the deeds of foul play they have
practised on us. I am deeply indebted to
this bird of prey from whom I have
received the teaching. There is no offence
in adopting plans to suit one&rsquo;s altered
circumstances. If we can lawfully attack
an enemy, when his army is tired or when
his forces are scattered, why then should
not we, who have lost our armies, attack
our enemies when they are asleep? There
can be nothing wrong in it. Indeed it is
only thus that we can punish and defeat
these Pandavas who have achieved
successes through foul play. We have no
other course open.&rdquo;
Aswatthama made up his mind and he
immediately woke up Kripacharya and
informed him of his plan. Kripacharya,
who heard it, was astonished.
&ldquo;This can never be,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is wholly
wrong. To attack men who have retired to
sleep, has never been done before. It
would be an unprecedented crime against
the
laws
of
kshatriya
conduct.
Aswatthama, for whom are we fighting?The man for whose sake we joined in this
war has been fatally wounded and his end
has arrived. We have discharged our
obligations most loyally. We fought our
best for the greedy and wrongheaded
Duryodhana but we failed irretrievably.
There is no purpose now in our continuing
the fight and it is folly to do so. Let us go
to Dhritarashtra and the faultless
Gandhari, and place ourselves at their
disposal. Let us take counsel of wise
Vidura also. They will tell us what lies
before us to do.&rdquo;
When
Kripacharya
spoke
thus,
Aswatthama&rsquo;s
grief
and
indignation
increased and he spoke bitterly:
&ldquo;Everyone feels sure that what he thinks is
the only right and proper thing to do.
One&rsquo;s understanding naturally limits one&rsquo;s
vision. These Pandavas have been guilty
of the foulest conduct. They killed my
noble and trustful father through a lie.
They have killed Duryodhana against the
laws of chivalry. I have no doubt in my
mind that what I propose to do is quite
proper vengeance for all these foul deeds.
It is only if I carry out this plan that I can
possibly repay my debt to my king and to
my father. I have decided on it and I do
not propose to alter my plan. I am going
tonight to the tents where they are
sleeping having cast off their armor and
there I will kill the Pandavas and
Dhrishtadyumna while they are asleep.&rdquo;
Kripacharya was deeply grieved to hear
Aswatthama speak thus: &ldquo;You have
attained a great name among men,&rdquo; he
pleaded, &ldquo;Your spotless character will by
this be blemished, even like a milk-white
cloth bespattered with blood. Never could
it be right to kill sleeping men. Desist
from this.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir, what are you talking? These
Pandavas butchered my father when he
had thrown away all his weapons and had
sat down in prayer. These men have
breached the embankment of dharma and
released the flood, and not a, drop of
dharma is now left! Karna, who was on
the ground putting right the wheel of his
chariot, was murdered by these lawless
rascals. Bhima has killed Duryodhana
with a blow below the navel. What
dharma has been left for us to follow? The
Pandavas have, once for all, destroyed the
wall of dharma. Why should we make
research into law and chivalry when
dealing with these ruffians who have
attained successes by destroying both? If
by killing the sleeping Panchalas, who
butchered my great father, I may be
doomed to rebirth in the body of a foul
bird or of a wriggling worm, I do not care.
I seek such a birth!&rdquo;
Saying this and, without waiting for an
answer, Aswatthama proceeded to harness
his horses and get his chariot ready to
start. When he was about to leave
Kripacharya and Kritavarma cried: &ldquo;Stop.
What are you resolved upon doing,
Aswatthama? We cannot approve of it,
but neither can we desert you in your
desperate enterprise. The path you are
bent on treading, we shall also follow. The
sin you are resolved upon, let us share
also.&rdquo; So, they went along with him. Thus
does evil grow! One transgression begets
the next and thus evil grows from evil
submerging righteousness. Evil flourishes
on retaliation.
They reached the Pandava camp.
Dhrishtadyumna had doffed his armor and
was plunged in deep slumber in his tent.
Aswatthama leapt on the sleeping warrior
and, before he could put himself into a
posture of defence, cruelly kicked him to
death.
The same process was relentlessly
repeated until all the Panchalas and all the
sons of Draupadi were killed one by one
when they were plunged in sleep in their
tents.After having done this deed, the like of
which had never before been considered
possible among kshatriyas, Kripacharya,
Kritavarma and Aswatthama came out of
the tents and set fire to the camp. When
the fire spread, the sleeping soldiers were
awakened and fled hither and thither in
confusion, even like the crows on the
banian tree under which they had rested in
the forest, and they were mercilessly
slaughtered by Aswatthama.
&ldquo;We have done our duty,&rdquo; said
Dronacharya&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Let us go and give
the glad news to Duryodhana, if we can
reach him, before he expires. Let him die
pleased.&rdquo;
The three of them accordingly hurried to
Duryodhana.</p>
