  <p>CHITRANGADA, the son of Satyavati,
was killed in battle with a Gandharva. As
he
died
childless,
his
brother,
Vichitravirya, was the rightful heir and
was duly crowned king. And as he was a
minor, Bhishma governed the kingdom in
his name till be came of age.
When Vichitravirya reached adolescence
Bhishma cast about for a bride for him.
And as he heard that the daughters of the
king of Kasi were to choose theirhusbands
according to the ancient Kshatriya
practice he went there to secure them for
his brother.
The rulers of Kosla, Vanga, Pundra,
Kalinga and other princes and potentates
had also repaired to Kasi for the
swayamvara, attired in their best. The
princesses were so far-famed for beauty
and accomplishments that there was fierce
competition to win them.
Bhishma was famous among the
Kshatriyas as a mighty man-at-arms. At
first everyone thought that the redoubtable
hero had come merely to witness the
festivities of the swayamvara. But when
they found that he was also a suitor, the
young princes felt themselves let down
and were full of chagrin. They did not
know that he had really come for the sake
of his brother, Vichitravirya.
The princes began to cast affronts at
Bhishma: &ldquo;This most excellent and wise
descendant of the Bharata race forgets that
he is too old and forgets also his vow of
celibacy. What has this old man to do with
this swayamvara? Fie on him!&rdquo; The
princesses who were to choose their
husbands barely glanced at the old man
and looked away.
Bhishma&rsquo;s
wrath
flamed
up.
He
challenged the assembled princes to a trial
of their manhood and defeated them all.
And taking the three princesses in his
chariot he set out for Hastinapura.
But before he had gone far, Salva, the
king of the Saubala country who was
attached to Amba, intercepted and
opposed him. For that princess had
mentally chosen Salva as her husband.
After a bitter fight Salva was worsted, and
no wonder, as Bhishma was a peerless
bowman. But at the request of the
princesses Bhishma spared his life.
Arriving
in
Hastinapura
with
the
princesses, Bhishma made preparations
for their marriage to Vichitravirya. When
all were assembled for the marriage,
Amba smiled mockingly at Bhishma and
addressed him as follows: &ldquo;O son of
Ganga, you are aware of what is enjoined
in the scriptures. I have mentally chosen
Salva, the king of Saubala, as my
husband. You have brought me here by
force. Knowing this, do what you, learned
in the scriptures, should do.&rdquo;
Bhishma admitted the force of her
objection and sent her to Salva with
proper escort. The marriage of Ambika
and Ambalika, the two younger sisters,
with Vichitravirya was duly solemnised.
Amba went rejoicing to Salva and told
him what had happened: &ldquo;I have mentally
chosen you as my husband from the very
start. Bhishma has sent me to you. Marry
me according to the sastras.&rdquo;
Salva replied: &ldquo;Bhishma defeated me in
sight of all, and carried you away. I have
been disgraced. So, I cannot receive you
now as my wife. Return to him and do as
he commands.&rdquo; With these words Salva
sent her back to Bhishma.
She returned to Hastinapura and told
Bhishma of what had taken place. The
grandsire tried to induce Vichitravirya to
marry her. But Vichitravirya roundly
refused to marry a maiden whose heart
had already been given to another.
Amba then turned to Bhishma and she
sought him to marry her himself as there
was no other recourse. It was impossiblefor Bhishma to break his vow, sorry as he
was for Amba. And after some vain
attempts to make Vichitravirya change his
mind, he told her there was no way left to
her but to go again to Salva and seek to
persuade him.
This at first she was too proud to do, and
for long years she abode in Hastinapura.
Finally, in sheer desperation, she went to
Salva and found him adamant in refusal.
The lotus-eyed Amba spent six bitter
years in sorrow and baffled hope. And her
heart was seared with suffering and all the
sweetness in her turned to gall and fierce
hatred towards Bhishma as the cause of
her blighted life.
She sought in vain for a champion among
the princes to fight and kill Bhishma and
thus avenge her wrongs but even the
foremost warriors were afraid of Bhishma
and paid no heed to her appeal.
At last, she resorted to hard austerities to
get the grace of Lord Subrahmanya. He
graciously appeared before her and gave
her a garland of ever-fresh lotuses, saying
that the wearer of that garland would
become the enemy of Bhishma.
Amba took the garland and again be
sought every Kshatriya to accept the
garland gift of the six-faced Lord and to
champion her cause. But no one had the
hardihood to antagonise Bhishma.
Finally, she went to King Drupada who
also refused to grant her prayer. She then
hung the garland at Drupada&rsquo;s palace gate
and went away to the forest. Some
ascetics whom she met there and to whom
she told her sorrowful tale advised her to
go to Parasurama as a suppliant. She
followed their advice.
On hearing her sad story, Parasurama was
moved with compassion and said: &ldquo;Dear
child, what do you want? I can ask Salva
to marry you if you wish it.&rdquo;
Amba said: &ldquo;No, I do not wish it. I no
longer desire marriage or home or
happiness. There is now but one thing in
life for me, revenge on Bhishma. The only
boon I seek is the death of Bhishma.&rdquo;
Parasurama moved as much by her
anguish as by his abiding hatred of the
Kshatriya race, espoused her cause and
fought with Bhishma. It was a long and
equal combat between the two greatest
men-at-arms of the age. But in the end
Parasurama had to acknowledge defeat.
He told Amba: &ldquo;I have done all that I
could and I have failed. Throw yourself
on the mercy of Bhishma. That is the only
course left to you.&rdquo;
Consumed with grief and rage, and kept
alive only by the passion for revenge,
Amba went to the Himalayas and
practised rigorous austerities to get the
grace of Siva, now that all human aid had
failed her. Siva appeared before her and
granted her a boon, that in her next birth
she would slay Bhishma.
Amba was impatient for that rebirth which
would give her heart&rsquo;s desire. She made a
pyre and plunged into the fire pouring out
the flame in her heart into the scarcely
hotter blaze of the pyre.
By the grace of Lord Siva, Amba was
born as the daughter of King Drupada. A
few years after her birth, she saw the
garland of never-fading flowers that still
hung at the palace gate and had remained
there untouched by anyone through fear.
She put it round her neck. Her father
Drupada was in consternation at her
temerity which he feared would draw on
his head the wrath of Bhishma.
He sent his daughter in exile out of the
capital to the forest. She practised
austerities in the forest and in time was
transformed into a male and became
known as the warrior Sikhandin.
With Sikhandin as his charioteer, Arjuna
attacked Bhishma on the battlefield of
Kurukshetra.
Bhishma
knew
that
Sikhandin was born as female, and true tohis code of chivalry he would not fight
him under any circumstance.
So it was that Arjuna could fight screened
by Sikhandin and conquer Bhishma,
especially because Bhishma knew that his
long and weary probation on earth was
finished and consented to be vanquished.
As the arrows struck Bhishma in his last
fight, he singled out those which had
pierced him deepest and said: &ldquo;This is
Arjuna&rsquo;s arrow and not Sikhandin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; So
fell this great warrior.</p>
