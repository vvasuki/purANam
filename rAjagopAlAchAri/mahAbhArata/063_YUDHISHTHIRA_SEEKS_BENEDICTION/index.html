  <p>EVERYTHING was ready for the battle
to begin. At this tense moment, both
armies saw with amazement Yudhishthira,
the steadfast and brave son of Pandu,
suddenly doff his armor and put away his
weapons. Descending from his chariot, he
proceeded on foot towards the commander
of the Kaurava forces.
&ldquo;What is this that Yudhishthira is doing?&rdquo;
asked everyone and was puzzled by this
sudden and silent proceeding on the part
of the Pandava.
Dhananjaya too was perplexed and he
jumped down from his chariot and ran to
Yudhishthira. The other brothers and
Krishna also joined.
They feared that perhaps Yudhishthira,
surrendering to his natural inclination, had
suddenly decided to seek peace on any
terms and was going forward to announce
this.
&ldquo;King, why are you proceeding to the
enemy&rsquo;s lines in this strange manner? You
have told us nothing. The enemy is ready
for battle, their soldiers sheathed in armor
and with uplifted weapons. But you have
doffed your armor and thrown aside your
weapons and are proceeding forward,
unattended and on foot. Tell us what you
are about.&rdquo; Thus said Arjuna to
Dharmaputra. But Yudhishthira was
immersed in deep thought and proceeded
forward silently.
Then Vasudeva, who knew the hearts of
men, smiled and said: &ldquo;He is going to the
elders to ask for their benediction before
commencing this terrible fight. He feels it
is not right to start such a grave
proceeding without formally taking such
benediction and permission. He goes to
the grandsire to take his blessing and that
of Dronacharya. So he goes unarmed. It is
right that he does this. He knows
proprieties. It is only thus that we might
fare well in this battle.&rdquo;
The men in Duryodhana&rsquo;s army, when
they saw Yudhishthira advancing with
hands clasped in humble attitude, thought:&ldquo;Here is the Pandava coming to sue for
peace, frightened at our strength. Truly
this man brings disgrace to the race of
kshatriyas. Why was this coward born
among us?&rdquo; Thus did they talk among
themselves reviling Dharmaputra though
delighted at the prospect of securing
victory without a blow.
Yudhishthira went through the lines of
soldiers armed from head to foot and
proceeded straight to where Bhishma was
and, bending low and touching his feet in
salutation, said:
&ldquo;Grandsire, permit us to begin the battle.
We have dared to give battle to you, our
unconquerable
and
incomparable
grandsire. We seek benediction before
beginning the fight.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; replied the grandsire, &ldquo;born in the
race of Bharatas, you have acted worthily
and according to our code of conduct. It
gives me joy to see this. Fight and you
will have victory. I am not a free agent. I
am bound by my obligation to the king
and must fight on the side of the
Kauravas. But you will not be defeated.&rdquo;
After thus obtaining the permission and
the
blessings
of
the
grandsire,
Yudhishthira went to Drona and
circumambulated and bowed, according to
form, to the acharya, who also gave his
blessings, saying:
&ldquo;I am under inescapable obligations to the
Kauravas, O son of Dharma. Our vested
interests enslave us and become our
masters. Thus have I become bound to the
Kauravas. I shall fight on their side. But
yours will be the victory.&rdquo;
Yudhishthira similarly approached and
obtained the blessings of Kripacharya and
uncle Salya and returned to the Pandava
lines.
The battle began, commencing with single
combats between the leading chiefs armed
with equal weapons. Bhishma and Partha,
Satyaki and Kritavarma, Abhimanyu and
Brihatbala, Duryodhana and Bhima,
Yudhishthira
and
Salya,
and
Dbrishtadyumna and Drona were thus
engaged in great battles.
Similarly, thousands of other warriors
fought severally according to the rules of
war of those days.
Besides these numerous single combats
between renowned warriors, there was
also
indiscriminate
fighting
among
common soldiers. The name of &ldquo;sankula
yuddha&rdquo; was given to such free fighting
and
promiscuous
carnage.
The
Kurukshetra battle witnessed many such
&ldquo;sankula&rdquo; fights wherein countless men
fought and died in the mad lust of battle.
On the field lay piles of slaughtered
soldiers, charioteers, elephants and horses.
The ground became a bloody mire in
which it was difficult for the chariots to
move about. In modern battles there is no
such thing as single combats. It is all
&ldquo;sankula.&rdquo;
The Kauravas fought under Bhishma&rsquo;s
command for ten days. After him, Drona
took the command. When Drona died,
Karna succeeded to the command. Karna
fell towards the close of the seventeenth
day&rsquo;s battle. And Salya led the Kaurava
army on the eighteenth and last day.
Towards the latter part of the battle, many
savage and unchivalrous deeds were done.
Chivalry and rules of war die hard, for
there is an innate nobility in human
nature. But difficult situations and
temptations arise which men are too weak
to resist, especially when they are
exhausted with fighting and warped with
hatred and bloodshed.
Even great men commit wrong and their
lapses thereafter furnish bad examples to
others, and dharma comes to be
disregarded more and more easily and
frequently. Thus does violence beget and
nourish adharma and plunge the world in
wickedness.64. THE FIRST DAY&rsquo;S BATTLE
DUHSASANA was leading the Kaurava
forces and Bhimasena did the same on the
Pandava side. The noise of battle rolled
and rent the air. The kettledrums,
trumpets, horns and conchs made the sky
ring with their clamor.
Horses
neighed,
charging
elephants
trumpeted and the warriors uttered their
lion-roars. Arrows flew in the air like
burning meteors. Fathers and sons, uncles
and nephews slew one another forgetful of
old affection and ties of blood. It was a
mad and terrible carnage. In the forenoon
of the first day&rsquo;s battle the Pandava army
was badly shaken. Wherever Bhishma&rsquo;s
chariot went, it was like the dance of the
destroyer. Abhimanyu could not bear this
and he attacked the grandsire. When the
oldest and the youngest warriors thus met
in battle, the gods came to watch the
combat. Abhimanyu&rsquo;s flag, displaying the
golden karnikara tree brightly waved on
his chariot.
Kritavarma was hit by one of his arrows
and Salya was hit five times. Bhishma
himself
was
hit
nine
times
by
Abhimanyu&rsquo;s
shafts.
Durmukha&rsquo;s
charioteer was struck by one of
Abhimanyu&rsquo;s sword-edge arrow and his
severed head rolled on the ground.
Another broke Kripa&rsquo;s bow. Abhimanyu&rsquo;s
feats brought down showers of flowers
from the gods who looked on. Bhishma
and the warrior supporting him exclaimed:
&ldquo;Indeed, a worthy son to Dhananjaya!&rdquo;
Then the Kaurava warriors made a
combined attack on the valiant youth. But
he stood against them all. He parried with
his own all the shafts discharged by
Bhishma.
One of his well-aimed arrows brought the
grandsire&rsquo;s palm tree flag down. Seeing
this, Bhimasena was overjoyed and made
a great lion-roar that further inspired the
valiant nephew. Great was the grandsire&rsquo;s
joy, seeing the valor of the young hero.
Unwillingly, he had to use his full
strength against the boy. Virata, his son
Uttara, Dhrishtadyumna, the son of
Drupada and Bhima came to relieve the
young hero and attacked the grandsire
who then turned his attentions on them.
Uttara, the son of Virata, rode an elephant
and led a fierce charge on Salya. Salya&rsquo;s
chariot horses were trampled to death and
thereupon he hurled a javelin at Uttara. It
went with unerring aim and pierced him in
the chest.
The goad he had in his hand dropped and
he rolled down dead. But the elephant did
not withdraw. It continued charging until
Salya cut off its trunk and hit it in many
places with his arrows. And then it uttered
a loud cry and fell dead. Salya got into
Kritavarma&rsquo;s car.
Virata&rsquo;s son Sveta saw Salya slay his
younger brother. His anger rose, like fire
fed by libations of butter. And he drove
his chariot towards Salya. Seven chariot
warriors at once came up in support of
Salya and protected him from all sides.
Arrows were showered on Sveta and the
missiles sped across like lightning in
clouds.
Sveta
defended
himself
marvelously. He parried their shafts with
his own and cut their javelins down as
they sped towards him. The warriors in
both armies were amazed at the skill
displayed by Sveta. Duryodhana lost no
time now and sent forces to relieve Salya.
Whereupon there was a great battle.
Thousands of soldiers perished, and
numerous were the chariots broken and
the horses and elephants killed. Sveta
succeeded in putting Duryodhana&rsquo;s men to
flight and he pushed forward and attacked
Bhishma.
Bhishma&rsquo;s flag was brought down by
Sveta. Bhishma, in his turn, killed Sveta&rsquo;s
horses and charioteer. There upon, theyhurled javelins at one another and fought
on.
Sveta took a mace, and swinging it, sent it
at Bhishma&rsquo;s car which was smashed to
pieces. But the grandsire, even before the
mace dashed against the chariot, had
anticipated it and jumped down. From the
ground he pulled the string of his bow to
his ear and sent a fatal arrow at Sveta.
Sveta was struck and fell dead. Duhsasana
blew his horn and danced in joy. This was
followed by a great attack on the Pandava
army by Bhishma.
The Pandava forces suffered greatly on
the first day of the battle. Dharmaputra
was seized with apprehension, and
Duryodhana&rsquo;s joy was unbounded. The
brothers came to Krishna and were
engaged in anxious consultations.
&ldquo;Chief among Bharatas,&rdquo; said Krishna to
Yudhishthira, &ldquo;do not fear. God has
blessed you with valiant brothers. Why
should you entertain any doubts? There is
Satyaki and there are Virata, Drupada and
Dhrishtadyumna, besides myself. What
reason is there for you to be dejected? Do
you forget that Sikhandin is awaiting for
his predestined victim Bhishma?&rdquo; Thus
did Krishna comfort Yudhishthira.</p>
